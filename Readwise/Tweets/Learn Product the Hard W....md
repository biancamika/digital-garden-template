## Highlights
- Learn Product The Hard Way
  ðŸ§µA guide to help break into product by '21 in 12 tweets
- [1/12] 
  Folks more experienced than me have written so read these first:
  1. @lennysan on https://t.co/c3s7Cq1Ei1
  2. @sachinrekhi on https://t.co/TkHmons8LE
  3. @gibsonbiddle on https://t.co/TouYP1v25A 
  4. @ajwaxman on https://t.co/maeNZKAS4l
- [2/12] It felt some of these didn't apply to ecosystems outside the major startup hubs:
  1. fewer opportunities (non-existent APM programs)
  2. nascent prod culture (ecosystem still understanding role ie PM is CEO mythðŸ˜±)
  Also 2021 is different - it is time to build!
- [3/12] 2 questions I kept getting from aspiring PM:
  1. How to get required product experience for an early role?
  2. How to make up for the lack of technical knowledge?
  Short answers:
  1. You don't need a product role for the experience
  2. Not all prod roles need deep tech chops
  ðŸ‘‡
- [4/12] Before diving we need to understand the role:
  1. @shreyas on https://t.co/tmt1kkZQR4
  2. @sachinrekhi on https://t.co/jiUzObcSCE
  3. @far33d on https://t.co/Won2MelZiX
  Also PM is NOT CEO. CEO role is a superset and besides prod also worries about funding, hiring, et al
- [5/12] Now let's talk about getting product experience without that first role. I reccomend two strategies:
  1. public product tear downs 
  2. build something -- I know Lenny said it is hardest path but 2021 is different thanks to rise of NoCode, also focus on PM and not being CEO
- [6/12] You can build Product sense without a formal PM role. Start by making a Substack and do full stack teardown of products that interest you much like https://t.co/MSSpN80F7p but include your guesses around:
  1. metrics
  2. growth loops
  3. eng. stack
  4. write mock PRD (why not)
- [7/12] Now let's talk about BUILDING. Product building is a hypothesis driven process https://t.co/BHxoVofQdr
  And the right set of operations/hypothesis in the right order is what we call prioritization/roadmapping. It is one of the most essential pm skills
- [8/12] https://t.co/C3rdISTsAE is making all the buzz. If you want to get PM experience it is as easy as building a tiny vision eg New Kitten Parent Community, setting up some success metrics, hypothesis and executing to record learnings. You don't need a role/permission to start
- [9/12] Things that you will not want to focus on: raising money, some multi-year strategy to get to $1bn, thinking hiring or org design. You want to focus on the bottom yellow boxes here - https://t.co/GiVw3zxP4o
- [11/12] https://t.co/aR1Jzxxrnk and https://t.co/08t2Grp5pH are great resources when thinking about analytics and metrics
- [12/12] SO NOW IS THE TIME TO BUILD and get that product experience. JUST DO IT because you can; without permission.
  What about tech chops? Will post sep. thread
- [12+1] @shreyas correctly pointed out that practising to communicate well is key. Here are some resources on this topic:
