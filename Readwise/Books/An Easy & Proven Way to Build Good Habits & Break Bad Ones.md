## Highlights
### Introduction: My Story
- “To write a great book, you must first become the book.” (Page 8)
### 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. (Page 20)
- But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. (Page 21)
- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential (Page 21)
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. (Page 23)
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals. (Page 24)
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. (Page 25)
- In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. (Page 25)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness. (Page 26)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. (Page 27)
### 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- The first layer is changing your outcomes. (Page 30)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- The second layer is changing your process. (Page 30)
- The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. (Page 30)
- Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. (Page 32)
- The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. (Page 35)
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Page 36)
- Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” (Page 37)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself. (Page 37)
- We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self. (Page 38)
- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. (Page 38)
- It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time. (Page 39)
- Decide the type of person you want to be.
  Prove it to yourself with small wins. (Page 39)
- “What would a healthy person do?” (Page 40)
### 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” (Page 44)
- “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” (Page 45)
- Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. (Page 46)
- Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks. (Page 46)
- Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. (Page 46)
- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. (Page 47)
- The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. (Page 48)
- We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. (Page 49)
- Four Laws of Behavior Change (Page 53)
- How to Create a Good Habit
  The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
  The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
  The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
  The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. (Page 54)
- How to Break a Bad Habit
  Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
  Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
  Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
  Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying. (Page 54)
### 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
- Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. (Page 62)
- “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” (Page 62)
- This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. (Page 63)
- Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. (Page 63)
- We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. (Page 64)
- We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. (Page 64)
- “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” (Page 65)
- The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. (Page 66)
- Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. (Page 66)
### 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. (Page 70)
- “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” (Page 70)
- people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. (Page 70)
- I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. (Page 71)
- Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. (Page 72)
- The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. (Page 73)
- No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior. (Page 73)
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. (Page 74)
- “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” (Page 74)
- No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off. (Page 77)
- Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. (Page 77)
- Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. (Page 78)
### 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. (Page 82)
- In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent. (Page 83)
- Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). (Page 83)
- customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them. (Page 83)
- Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones. (Page 84)
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. (Page 86)
- Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. (Page 87)
- The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. (Page 87)
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. (Page 87)
- Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. (Page 87)
- habits can be easier to change in a new environment. (Page 88)
- When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. (Page 89)
- avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. (Page 89)
- A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form. (Page 90)
### 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. (Page 92)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises (Page 93)
- If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop. (Page 93)
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. (Page 93)
- “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. (Page 94)
- You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. (Page 94)
- A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. (Page 94)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] [[personal development]] 
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. (Page 95)
- Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. (Page 95)
### 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality (Page 102)
- Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. (Page 102)
- dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. (Page 106)
- It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. (Page 106)
- Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. (Page 106)
- We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. (Page 108)
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. (Page 109)
- You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy (Page 110)
- After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
  After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]. (Page 110)
- Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want. (Page 111)
### 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
  The close.
  The many.
  The powerful. (Page 116)
- the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. (Page 116)
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. (Page 117)
- Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. (Page 117)
- The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run. (Page 118)
    - Tags: [[culture]] [[community]] [[personal development]] 
- Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” (Page 120)
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. (Page 120)
- There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. (Page 120)
- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. (Page 121)
- We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. (Page 121)
- Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out. (Page 121)
### 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. (Page 127)
- At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and (Page 127)
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. (Page 128)
- Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. (Page 128)
- Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. (Page 128)
- Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. (Page 129)
- Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. (Page 129)
- our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves. (Page 129)
- These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. (Page 129)
- A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. (Page 129)
- Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. (Page 129)
- What you really want is to feel different. (Page 130)
- the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. (Page 130)
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment. (Page 130)
- Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. (Page 131)
- If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. (Page 132)
- The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. (Page 133)
### 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. (Page 142)
- Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. (Page 142)
- motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. (Page 142)
- When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. (Page 143)
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. (Page 143)
- The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. (Page 143)
- Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” (Page 143)
- Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. (Page 143)
- Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned. (Page 144)
- All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. (Page 144)
- habits form based on frequency, not time. (Page 145)
### 12: The Law of Least Effort
- our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. (Page 151)
- Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. (Page 151)
- Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We are motivated to do what is easy. (Page 151)
- every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. (Page 152)
- You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. (Page 152)
- The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. (Page 152)
- addition by subtraction. (Page 154)
- when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (Page 154)
- If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. (Page 154)
- successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. (Page 155)
- Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion. (Page 155)
- Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones. (Page 155)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. (Page 156)
- You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad behaviors difficult. (Page 157)
### 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- In this way, the habits you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are thinking. (Page 160)
- Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. (Page 160)
- Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. (Page 161)
- The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” (Page 162)
- The point is to master the habit of showing up. (Page 163)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. (Page 165)
- Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. (Page 165)
- you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. (Page 165)
### 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. (Page 169)
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. (Page 170)
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. (Page 172)
- Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. (Page 173)
- The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work. (Page 174)
- By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed. (Page 175)
### 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
- The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was consistency. (Page 184)
- Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating. (Page 185)
- Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. (Page 186)
- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction. (Page 186)
- You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes. (Page 187)
- You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff. (Page 187)
- the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future. (Page 189)
- the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.* (Page 189)
- update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. (Page 189)
- The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. (Page 190)
- In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background. (Page 191)
- The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. (Page 191)
- Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. (Page 191)
- One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. (Page 191)
- It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. (Page 192)
- The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (Page 192)
- Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker. (Page 196)
- In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.* (Page 198)
### 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:
  After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]. (Page 200)
- never miss twice. (Page 201)
- The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. (Page 201)
- This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding. (Page 201)
- The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. (Page 202)
- Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” (Page 203)
- This is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. The number on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number, your motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid ways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling motivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it’s time to focus on a different measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress. (Page 203)
### 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful (Page 206)
- The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds. (Page 206)
- A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. (Page 208)
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. (Page 218)
- Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with different abilities. (Page 218)
- Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success. (Page 219)
- Competence is highly dependent on context. (Page 219)
- genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity. (Page 219)
- Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. (Page 220)
- Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. (Page 220)
- The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality.* (Page 221)
### 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)
- explore/exploit trade-off.
  In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. (Page 223)
- The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.
  After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. (Page 223)
- In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. (Page 223)
- What feels like fun to me, but work to others? (Page 224)
- The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. (Page 224)
- What makes me lose track of time? (Page 224)
- Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (Page 224)
- What comes naturally to me? (Page 225)
- Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. (Page 226)
- genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work. (Page 227)
- the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.” (Page 231)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] 
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. (Page 231)
### 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state.*
  A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. (Page 232)
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. (Page 234)
- Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. (Page 234)
- Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom. (Page 235)
- In psychology, this is known as a variable reward. (Page 235)
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. (Page 236)
- The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom. (Page 236)
### 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. (Page 239)
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery (Page 240)
- Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. (Page 240)
    - Tags: [[personal development]] [[learning]] 
- Establish a system for reflection and review. (Page 242)
- Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. (Page 244)
- Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. (Page 246)
- Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. (Page 247)
