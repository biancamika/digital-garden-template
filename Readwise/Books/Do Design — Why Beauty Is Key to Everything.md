## Highlights
### 2. What did astronaut Edgar Mitchell have to say about beauty?
- salve corpus amanti, literally translated as ‘save the lover’s body’. (Page 0)
### 3. The most beautiful question in the world
- Is the world a work of art? (Page 0)
### 4. The roots of design
- the question of beauty takes us away from the surfaces to thinking about the core foundations of things. (Page 0)
### 5. The enduring utility, honesty and beauty in Shaker design
- all useful things should also be beautiful. God, as architect Mies van der Rohe said, was in the details and, you never know, an angel may come one day and sit on that chair – it had to be worthy of such an event. (Page 0)
### 6. What world was Doug Engelbart trying to create?
- if you cannot describe a new destination, you will never get there. (Page 0)
- the limits of our language are the limits of our world. A new language enables us to make the transition from where we are now, to where we need to get to. It lets us leap disciplinary boundaries. If we can’t describe it, then we struggle to make it. (Page 0)
### 7. The troubled man and the mountain
- But without a guiding philosophy, we end up stripping away our navigational compass and losing sight first of our humanity, then our potential. (Page 0)
### 8. The great stillness
- To bring great stillness into one’s work means one can truly commit to its execution and most beautiful realisation. It is commitment, Tashi says, that gives you freedom. (Page 0)
### 9. A quest for truth is always core to the purpose of a poet
- important characteristics of craftsmanship: a granite-like integrity and a deep empathy for the world around him. (Page 0)

- importance of language: its ability to uplift us, or to shape the way we see and therefore act in the world. (Page 0)
### 10. Reality is full of depth of field
- by removing the distance between subject and observer, empathy gifts us a huge depth of field. It allows us to create works of great truth and great beauty. (Page 0)
### 13. The Bill Bailey principle for making the new
- ‘The greatest enemy of creative success is the attempt to fortify against failure.’ (Page 0)
### 15. Start with the space between the lines
- labour at your work until people cannot imagine what you have designed existing any other way. Beauty is work well resolved. It is simple. (Page 0)
### 16. The world is sensual and textured
- Why does art endure? Because it always one way or another speaks directly to our senses. (Page 0)
- The interface with design is humanity. Success is when we make a universal cultural contribution – scale that as you like. (Page 0)
### 17. The master of materials
- Design is based upon resolving how someone is going to use something. Great design is describing the very best experience for them, then moving towards that ideal. (Page 0)
### Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty
- ‘Feel’ is an important filtering system towards truth. (Page 0)
- a ‘pattern language’ of how that company broadly works. This can reveal our own blind spots and gaps in knowledge, suggesting new design possibilities. Everything is made up of component parts. (Page 0)
- Openness is a design tool offering new organisational, social and commercial capability. Openness is cultural – being open to new ideas. Openness is mutual – the sharing and redistribution of knowledge, information, data resources and wealth. (Page 0)
### 20. Time is earthed
- Some things can take the time they need. Not the time you think they need. Time, like the hedge, is earthed. (Page 0)
### 21. Love the work you do: Blitz Motorcycles
- Investing in loving what you do always costs time, money, and sometimes the odd scar and bruise. It repays that love with personal satisfaction, and in turn it inspires, guides and nurtures the spirit in others. (Page 0)
### 22. The beauty in leadership
- Allowing people to arrive at their own conclusions of what needs to be done, and embracing what they create, is another form of wise leadership. (Page 0)
- listening openly, making time, helping, being honest, and creating moments of opportunity where the individual and collective hand, heart and mind can begin to build the new. (Page 0)
### 23. People embrace what they create
- ensure people are the true co-creators of their future, that they are heard and listened to. (Page 0)
- If you want to build a ship, don’t give out orders and tell people exactly what to do. Teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. (Page 0)
### 27. Living off the coast of Utopia
- Navigating towards ways in which we can design with optimism to uplift our humanity and our planet. (Page 0)
### Appendix I:
- Branby calls his worldview and philosophy ‘The Total’, as it encompasses ethics, business, production process, products and the world we inhabit. For him, ‘What we take, what we make and what we waste’ are in fact all questions of ethics. We have, he says, an unlimited responsibility for ‘The Total’, a responsibility that we try but do not always succeed in taking. One part of that responsibility is the quality of the product and how many years it will endure. Rather than designing in obsolescence, Branby designs it out. (Page 0)
- Meaning is created through a craft approach to life. And in many ways it is a gift that we give to ourselves and to others. So craftsmanship does not only exist in the manufacture of ancient tools; it exists, or should exist, in all that we do. (Page 0)
