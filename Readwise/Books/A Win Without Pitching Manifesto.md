## Highlights
- To sell is to:
  Help the unaware
  Inspire the interested
  Reassure those who have formed intent
- Selling, therefore, is change management.
- Our thinking is our highest value product; we will not part with it without appropriate compensation.
- But our designs are merely the application of our strategy; and our strategy, when arrived at responsibly, is rooted in a thorough diagnosis.
- We will save the use of discounts for our best and longest serving clients at times when they need our support.
- Superior service does not improve profit; profit improves service.

- While others get by on slim margins, winning on price, we will use some of our greater profit margins to better ourselves and put greater distance between our competition and us.
- We will do great work for those who respect us and pay us our worth. From our rewards we will use our gifts to lift our families, inspire our communities and influence all of humankind. Focus, selectivity, respectful selling, continuous learning and conquering money â€“ these are but steps on our path.
- Profit is the proof of the worth of our enterprise. It validates our gifts and gives us the strength to make our mark on the world, and that is all we have ever wanted. Like all creative people, we only seek to create, and in doing so, somehow change the world.
