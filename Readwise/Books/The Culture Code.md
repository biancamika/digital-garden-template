## Highlights
### Introduction: When Two Plus Two Equals Ten
- But individual skills are not what matters. What matters is the interaction. (Page 0)
- status management. They are figuring out where they fit into the larger picture: Who is in charge? Is it okay to criticize someone’s idea? What are the rules here? Their interactions appear smooth, but their underlying behavior is riddled with inefficiency, hesitation, and subtle competition. Instead of focusing on the task, they are navigating their uncertainty about one another. (Page 0)
- Culture is a set of living relationships working toward a shared goal. It’s not something you are. It’s something you do. (Page 0)
- Like any language, belonging cues can’t be reduced to an isolated moment but rather consist of a steady pulse of interactions within a social relationship. (Page 10)
- Belonging cues are behaviors that create safe connection in groups (Page 10)
### Chapter 1: The Good Apples
- Belonging cues possess three basic qualities:
  1. Energy: They invest in the exchange that is occurring
  2. Individualization: They treat the person as unique and valued
  3. Future orientation: They signal the relationship will continue (Page 11)
### Chapter 2: The Billion-Dollar Day When Nothing Happened
- Page’s technique of igniting whole-group debates around solving tough problems sent a powerful signal of identity and connection, as did the no-holds-barred hockey games and wide-open Friday forums. (Everyone in the group talks and listens in roughly equal measure.) (Page 20)
- Cohesion happens not when members of a group are smarter but when they are lit up by clear, steady signals of safe connection. (Page 26)
- The commitment model, on the other hand, focused on developing a group with shared values and strong emotional bonds. (Page 26)
### Chapter 3: The Christmas Truce, the One-Hour Experiment, and the Missileers
- a personal question about their best times at work, an exercise that revealed their individual skills, a sweatshirt embroidered with their name. These signals didn’t take much time to deliver, but they made a huge difference because they created a foundation of psychological safety that built connection and identity. (Page 39)
### Chapter 4: How to Build Belonging
- They are energized and engaged, but at their core their members are oriented less around achieving happiness than around solving hard problems together. This task involves many moments of high-candor feedback, uncomfortable truth-telling, when they confront the gap between where the group is, and where it ought to be. (Page 55)
- I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know that you can reach them. (Page 56)
- Here is a safe place to give effort. (Page 56)
- Personal, up-close connection (Page 56)
- Performance feedback (Page 57)
- Big-picture perspective (Page 57)
### Chapter 5: How to Design for Belonging
- He was like a human version of a social app, and he made each connection with the same light, low-key, positive vibe. He had a gift of making these conversations seem utterly normal and, through that normalcy, special (Page 65)
- Collisions—defined as serendipitous personal encounters—are, he believes, the lifeblood of any organization, the key driver of creativity, community, and cohesion. (Page 66)
- When an idea becomes part of a language, it becomes part of the default way of thinking.” (Page 67)
- The most successful projects were those driven by sets of individuals who formed what Allen called “clusters of high communicators.” (Page 69)
- “If you can see the other person or even the area where they work, you’re reminded of them, and that brings a whole bunch of effects.” (Page 70)

- Closeness helps create efficiencies of connection. (Page 72)
- Dunbar Number, which reflects the cognitive limit to the number of people with whom we can have a stable social relationship (around 150). (Page 73)
### Chapter 6: Ideas for Action
- Creating safety is about dialing in to small, subtle moments and delivering targeted signals at key points. (Page 75)
- head tilted slightly forward, eyes unblinking, and eyebrows arched up. Their bodies were still, and they leaned toward the speaker with intent. The only sound they made was a steady stream of affirmations—yes, uh-huh, gotcha—that encouraged the speaker to keep going, to give them more. (Page 75)
- The key is to draw a distinction between interruptions born of mutual excitement and those rooted in lack of awareness and connection. (Page 75)
- “To create safety, leaders need to actively invite input,” (Page 77)
- it’s important not simply to tolerate the difficult news but to embrace it. (Page 77)
- Thank you for allowing me to coach you. (Page 78)
- thank-yous aren’t only expressions of gratitude; they’re crucial belonging cues that generate a contagious sense of safety, connection, and motivation. (Page 79)
- The groups I visited were uniformly obsessed with design as a lever for cohesion and interaction. (Page 81)
- I also saw it in smaller, simpler levers like coffee machines. (Page 81)
- Create spaces that maximize collisions. (Page 82)
- food really is part of our core business.” (Page 82)
- Others establish regular forums where anyone can bring an issue or question before the group’s leaders, no matter how controversial it might be. But no matter how strong the rule, the underlying key is to have leaders who seek out connection and make sure voices are heard. (Page 83)
- no meeting can end without everyone sharing something. (Page 83)
    - Tags: [[culture]] 
- Others hold regular reviews of recent work in which anybody can offer their two cents. (Pixar calls them Dailies, all-inclusive morning meetings where everybody gets the chance to offer input and feedback on recently created footage.) (Page 83)
- Their leaders do the menial work, cleaning and tidying the locker rooms—and along the way vividly model the team’s ethic of togetherness and teamwork. (Page 85)
- muscular humility—a mindset of seeking simple ways to serve the group. (Page 85)
- When we enter a new group, our brains decide quickly whether to connect. So successful cultures treat these threshold moments as more important than any other. (Page 86)
- They handled negatives through dialogue, first by asking if a person wants feedback, then having a learning-focused two-way conversation about the needed growth. They handled positives through ultraclear bursts of recognition and praise. (Page 87)
### Chapter 7: “Tell Me What You Want, and I’ll Help You”
- The term pilots use to describe this type of short-burst communication is notifications. A notification is not an order or a command. It provides context, telling of something noticed, placing a spotlight on one discrete element of the world. (Page 95)
- Unlike commands, they carry unspoken questions: (Page 95)
- sharing vulnerability. (Page 97)

### Chapter 8: The Vulnerability Loop
- It’s about sending a really clear signal that you have weaknesses, that you could use help. And if that behavior becomes a model for others, then you can set the insecurities aside and get to work, start to trust each other and help each other. (Page 104)
- vulnerability loop. A shared exchange of openness, it’s the most basic building block of cooperation and trust. (Page 104)
- Vulnerability doesn’t come after trust—it precedes it. Leaping into the unknown, when done alongside others, causes the solid ground of trust to materialize beneath our feet. (Page 107)
- Each loop was different, yet they shared a deeper pattern: an acknowledgment of limits, a keen awareness of the group nature of the endeavor. The signal being sent was the same: You have a role here. I need you. (Page 112)
- Exchanges of vulnerability, which we naturally tend to avoid, are the pathway through which trusting cooperation is built. (Page 112)
### Chapter 9: The Super-Cooperators
- intense vulnerability along with deep interconnectedness. (Page 120)
### Chapter 10: How to Create Cooperation in Small Groups
- We’re trying to create leaders among leaders. And you can’t just tell people to do that. You have to create the conditions where they start to do it.” (Page 138)
- “backbone of humility” (Page 141)
- The real courage is seeing the truth and speaking the truth to each other. (Page 145)
### Chapter 11: How to Create Cooperation with Individuals
- People in all kinds of disciplines, on all kinds of projects, talking about their project with someone who’s working on something entirely different, to put a new light on things. People like Harry Nyquist could capture what someone was doing, throw some new ideas at them, and ask, ‘Why don’t you try that? (Page 148)
- They were polite, reserved, and skilled listeners. They radiated a safe, nurturing vibe. They possessed deep knowledge that spanned domains and had a knack for asking questions that ignited motivation and ideas. (The best way to find the Nyquist is usually to ask people: If I could get a sense of the way your culture works by meeting just one person, who would that person be?) (Page 148)
- She’s incredibly skilled at unlocking teams, asking questions that connect people and open possibilities. The truth is, we don’t quite understand how she does it, exactly. We just know that it works really well. (Page 149)
- roving catalyst, involved in a number of projects, helping the teams navigate the design process. (Page 149)
- she gathers the group and asks questions designed to unearth tensions and help the group gain clarity about themselves and the project. The word she uses for this process is surfacing. (Page 150)
- For me, every conversation is the same, because it’s about helping people walk away with a greater sense of awareness, excitement, and motivation to make an impact. (Page 150)
- It’s never confrontational—she never says, ‘You’re doing the wrong thing.’ It’s organic, embedded in conversation.” (Page 151)
- She uses the idea of dance to describe the skills she employs with IDEO’s design teams: to find the music, support her partner, and follow the rhythm. “I don’t see myself as the conductor of the music,” she says. “I’m more of a nudger. I nudge the choreography and try to create the conditions for good things to happen.” (Page 152)

- This is because the real power of the interaction is located in the two-way emotional signaling that creates an atmosphere of connection that surrounds the conversation. (Page 153)
- What these healers all had in common was that they were brilliant listeners. (Page 154)
- Concordances happen when one person can react in an authentic way to the emotion being projected in the room (Page 155)
- He is demonstrating that the most important moments in conversation happen when one person is actively, intently listening. (Page 156)
- while questions comprise only 6 percent of verbal interactions, they generate 60 percent of ensuing discussions. (Page 157)
### Chapter 12: Ideas for Action
- What is one thing that I currently do that you’d like me to continue to do?
  • What is one thing that I don’t currently do frequently enough that you think I should do more often?
  • What can I do to make you more effective? (Page 159)
- 1. The first vulnerability
  2. The first disagreement (Page 161)
- They interact in ways that make the other person feel safe and supported
  2. They take a helping, cooperative stance
  3. They occasionally ask questions that gently and constructively challenge old assumptions
  4. They make occasional suggestions to open up alternative paths (Page 162)
- They are active responders, absorbing what the other person gives, supporting them, and adding energy to help the conversation gain velocity and altitude. (Page 162)
- effective listeners gain amplitude through repetition. When asking questions, they rarely stop at the first response. Rather, they find different ways to explore an area of tension, in order to reveal the truths and connections that will enable cooperation. (Page 163)
- “ ‘Say more about that.’ ” (Page 163)
- they should be made only after you establish what Givechi calls “a scaffold of thoughtfulness.” (Page 163)
- emotional pain and a sense of inefficiency. (Page 166)
### Chapter 13: Three Hundred and Eleven Words
- Technology inspires art, and art inspires technology (Page 178)
- Purpose isn’t about tapping into some mystical internal drive but rather about creating simple beacons that focus attention and engagement on the shared goal. Successful cultures do this by relentlessly seeking ways to tell and retell their story. (Page 180)
    - Tags: [[storytelling]] [[people]] [[culture]] 
- Here is where we are and Here is where we want to go. (Page 180)
- High-purpose environments are filled with small, vivid signals designed to create a link between the present moment and a future ideal. (Page 180)
- mental contrasting (Page 181)
- Envision a reachable goal, and envision the obstacles (Page 181)
- motivation is not a possession but rather the result of a two-part process of channeling your attention: Here’s where you’re at and Here’s where you want to go. (Page 182)
- The deeper neurological truth is that stories do not cloak reality but create it, triggering cascades of perception and motivation. (Page 182)
- Stories are not just stories; they are the best invention ever created for delivering mental models that drive behavior. (Page 182)
### Chapter 14: The Hooligans and the Surgeons
- to flood the environment with narrative links between what they were doing now and what it meant. (Page 196)
- High-proficiency environments help a group deliver a well-defined, reliable performance, while high-creativity environments help a group create something new. (Page 199)
### Chapter 15: How to Lead for Proficiency
- Creating engagement around a clear, simple set of priorities can function as a lighthouse, orienting behavior and providing a path toward a goal. (Page 210)
### Chapter 16: How to Lead for Creativity
- the lighthouse method: They create purpose by generating a clear beam of signals that link A (where we are) to B (where we want to be). (Page 215)
- a type who spoke quietly and tended to spend a lot of time observing, who had an introverted vibe and liked to talk about systems. I started to think of this type of person as a Creative Engineer. (Page 215)
- Building purpose in a creative group is not about generating a brilliant moment of breakthrough but rather about building systems that can churn through lots of ideas in order to help unearth the right choices. (Page 219)
- providing teams with tools and support to locate paths, make hard choices, and navigate the arduous process together. (Page 219)
- Japanese concept of kaizen, or continual improvement. (Page 221)
- This reflects the fundamental difference between leading for proficiency and leading for creativity: Meyer needs people to know and feel exactly what to do, while Catmull needs people to discover that for themselves. (Page 222)
- managing is a creative act, (Page 223)
    - Tags: [[people]] [[management]] [[creativity]] 
- It’s problem solving (Page 223)
- building creative purpose isn’t really about creativity. It’s about building ownership, providing support, and aligning group energy toward the arduous, error-filled, ultimately fulfilling journey of making something new. (Page 226)
    - Tags: [[favorite]] [[culture]] [[creativity]] 
- Their greatest project is building and sustaining the group itself. If they get their own relationships right, everything else will follow. (Page 229)
### Chapter 17: Ideas for Action
- Fill the group’s windshield with clear, accessible models of excellence.
  • Provide high-repetition, high-feedback training.
  • Build vivid, memorable rules of thumb (if X, then Y).
  • Spotlight and honor the fundamentals of the skill. (Page 230)
- Keenly attend to team composition and dynamics.
  • Define, reinforce, and relentlessly protect the team’s creative autonomy.
  • Make it safe to fail and to give feedback.
  • Celebrate hugely when the group takes initiative. (Page 231)
- One challenge of building purpose is to translate abstract ideas (values, mission) into concrete terms. One way successful groups do this is by spotlighting a single task and using it to define their identity and set the bar for their expectations. (Page 233)
