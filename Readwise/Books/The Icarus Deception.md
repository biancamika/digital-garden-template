## Highlights
### WE ARE ALL ARTISTS NOW
- Everyone in the room can care enough to do something—if they can overthrow the self-induced, systemically amplified censor that keeps them in line. (Page 0)
- industrial age built the trap we’re mired in, but it didn’t build the trap all at once; that took centuries to perfect. And we were seduced. Seduced by the bait of decent pay and plenty of prizes. Seduced by the apparent security of the enclosure. And once the gate was shut, we were kept in by the threat of shame, the amplification of risk, and society’s reliance on more and shinier prizes. (Page 0)
### Art, the Comfort Zone, and the Chance of a Lifetime
- Creating ideas that spread and connecting the disconnected are the two pillars of our new society, and both of them require the posture of the artist.
  Doing these two things regularly and with abandon is where the new safety zone lies. (Page 0)
- Art isn’t a result; it’s a journey. The challenge of our time is to find a journey worthy of your heart and your soul. (Page 0)
- We’ve had these doors open wide for only a decade or so, and most people have been brainwashed into believing that their job is to copyedit the world, not to design it. (Page 0)
- It’s far more dangerous to fly too low than too high, because it feels safe to fly low. We settle for low expectations and small dreams and guarantee ourselves less than we are capable of. By flying too low, we shortchange not only ourselves but also those who depend on us or might benefit from our work. We’re so obsessed about the risk of shining brightly that we’ve traded in everything that matters to avoid it. (Page 0)
- Art is an attitude, culturally driven and available to anyone who chooses to adopt it. (Page 0)
- Strategy and tactics live on the outside, in the cold world of consultants and spreadsheets. They are things we do without changing the way we think. Art, on the other hand, is personal, built on attitude and vision and commitment. (Page 0)
- Art is what we do when we’re truly alive. (Page 0)
- All we’re willing to pay you extra for is what we don’t assume, what we can’t get easily and regularly and for free. We need you to provide the things that are unexpected, scarce, and valuable. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[business]] 
- What’s scarce is trust, connection, and surprise. These are three elements in the work of a successful artist. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[creativity]] 
- What you feed the network changes what you get back. (Page 0)
- These are the new performing arts, the valuable visual arts, the essential personal arts. (Page 0)
- Art is threatening because it always involves moving away from the comfort zone into the unknown. (Page 0)
- The pain is part of being alive. Art is the narrative of being alive. (Page 0)
- Art always involves a collision with a marketplace, an interaction with a recipient, a gift given and a gift received. (Page 0)
- But if you hide your contribution from us, you can’t be considered an artist, because it’s not art until a human connection is made. (Page 0)
### The Connection Economy Demands That We Create Art
- We’re surrounded by the cruft of the industrial age, by the expectations, beliefs, and standards of an era that’s now over.
  What an opportunity. To be among the first to clean it out, to ignore it, to move to a different building altogether. A life without cruft slowing you down, a career with a focus on what you can create instead of what you must replicate. (Page 0)
- And so capitalism transformed the world. Everyone who trades benefits, and the retained capital buys machines and processes that improve productivity, so the benefits continue. (Page 0)
- The industrial model of command and control and the avoidance of failure now permeate every corner of the culture. (Page 0)
- Standardization in the industrial age was not a choice. It was impossible to industrialize without it.
  Originality and art in the connected age are not a choice, either. It’s impossible to do the work before us without them. It’s impossible to connect without art.
  The old safety zone is dead. Long live the new safety zone. (Page 0)
- Art isn’t about the rush of victory that comes from being picked. Nor does it involve compliance. Art in the postindustrial age is a lifelong habit, a stepwise process that incrementally allows us to create even more art. (Page 0)
- What matters now:
  Trust
  Permission
  Remarkability
  Leadership
  Stories that spread
  Humanity: connection, compassion, and humility (Page 0)
- miss? That is who you are listening to.
  REMARKABILITY: The same bias toward art exists in the way we choose which ideas we’ll share with our friends and colleagues. No one talks about the boring, the predictable, or the safe. We don’t risk interactions in order to spread the word about something obvious or trite.
  The remarkable is almost always new and untested, fresh and risky.
  LEADERSHIP: Management is almost diametrically opposed to leadership. Management is about generating yesterday’s results, but a little faster or a little more cheaply. We know how to manage the world—we relentlessly seek to cut costs and to limit variation, while we exalt obedience.
  Leadership, though, is a whole other game. Leadership puts the leader on the line. No manual, no rule book, no überleader to point the finger at when things go wrong. If you ask someone for the rule book on how to lead, you’re secretly wishing to be a manager.
  Leaders are vulnerable, not controlling, and they are taking us to a new place, not to the place of cheap, fast, compliant safety.
  STORIES THAT SPREAD: The next asset that makes the new economy work is the story that spreads[…] (Page 0)
- This abundance leads to two races. The race to the bottom is the Internet-fueled challenge to lower prices, find cheaper labor, and deliver more for less.
  The other race is the race to the top, the opportunity to be the one they can’t live without, to become a linchpin (whom we would miss if he didn’t show up). The race to the top focuses on delivering more for more. It embraces the weird passions of those with the resources to make choices, and it rewards originality, remarkability, and art. (Page 0)
- The laborer in the world of connection and art embraces the opportunity to do a little bit more, not less. Since emotional labor scales so dramatically, the ability to bring a little more to the table is the chance of a lifetime. “A little more” compounds, because ideas spread. A little more compounds because in a connected economy, word spreads and people flock to the art that means more.
  You don’t need more activity; you have to dig deeper instead. (Page 0)
- A hundred years of industrial brainwashing and a hundred years of cultural pressure make it hard for new employees to take promises like this at face value and hard for long-term employees to truly understand how gutsy the company wants them to be.
  At nonprofits, political campaigns, and cutting-edge companies, this disconnect happens daily. (Page 0)
- it’s easy to have a tantrum and to push ourselves away from the interaction and, worse, away from the person who just sought to serve us.
  The alternative is an interaction that creates a connection instead of destroying it. Where is the eye contact? Where is the dignity that comes from recognizing another? (Page 0)
- Connection Is the Outcome of Art
  How much connection did you just make? That’s one way to measure whether or not the work you did made a difference. (Page 0)
- Art is personal.
  Art is untested.
  Art is intended to connect. (Page 0)
- it turns out that expending emotional labor, working without a map, and driving in the dark involve confronting fear and living with the pain of vulnerability. The artist comes to a détente with these emotions and, instead of fighting with them, dances with them.
  The linchpin connects as a result of the indispensable nature of her contribution. The artist, on the other hand, connects because that’s what art is. The artist touches part of what it means to be truly human and does that work again and again. (Page 0)
- “Cruft” is the engineering term for the leftover detritus, useless computer code, broken devices, empty boxes, and junk that we have to maneuver around as technology advances. (Page 0)
- While technology might be a contributing factor, more than anything else, achievement comes from a culture that celebrates the achievement motive. (Page 0)
- the correlated element of success always seems to be that there are many individuals who care enough to want to succeed. (Page 0)
- The industrialist not only wants to make ever-more-productive trades, driving quality up and costs down, but insists on changing two things that have never been changed at a mammoth, worldwide scale before. (Page 0)
- Change the culture. (Page 0)
- Change our dreams. The overwhelming impact of more than a century of cultural indoctrination can’t be overstated. We have embraced industrial propaganda with such enthusiasm that we have changed the very nature of our dreams. (Page 0)
- By eliminating “personal” from frontline labor, the industrial system ensures that it can both maintain quality and use ever-cheaper (and ever-fewer) workers. (Page 0)
- But both the economics and the ethics of the last bit of industrialization don’t really scale. (Page 0)
- The industrial age that is fading all around us was built around productivity. The reason for all of it—for the exodus from farms, for the growth of mass media, for the standardization of schools, roads, and the marketplace—was that mass production, interchangeable parts, and the mass market were insanely productive. (Page 0)
- It might almost be said that the degree of standardization in any nation is a measure of its civilization, certainly in the material sense of the word (Page 0)
- Conformity was easier, safer, and cheaper than diversity. (Page 0)
- In this new safety zone, we are surrounded not by the mass market but by the weird, by the few who care deeply about what we’re capable of. This economy demands that we spin the log ever faster—doing not the work of making the same widget faster and cheaper in a race to the bottom but the work of connecting and entertaining and amazing with our most vivid dreams. (Page 0)
- The Internet and the connection economy turn the economics of mass on its head. It’s now cheaper and more efficient to make edgy, amazing products for the weird edge cases (who are listening and talking and who care) than it is to push yet another average product onto the already overloaded average people in the middle of the curve. (Page 0)
- The search for the right answer is the enemy of art. The right answer belongs to the productivity-minded industrialists, to Taylor and the denizens of Scientific Management. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[creativity]] 
- Art has no right answer. The best we can hope for is an interesting answer. (Page 0)
- All six of these are the result of successful work by artists. These assets aren’t generated by external strategies and MBAs and positioning memos. These are the results of internal trauma, of brave decisions and the willingness to live with dignity. (Page 0)
- we choose to listen to those we trust. We do business with and donate to those who have earned our attention. We seek out people who tell us stories that resonate, we listen to those stories, and we engage with those people or businesses who delight or reassure or surprise in a positive way. (Page 0)
- When price and availability are no longer sufficient advantages (because everything is available and the price is no longer news), then what we are drawn to is the vulnerability and transparency that bring us together, that turn the “other” into one of us. (Page 0)
- The extraordinary thing about our revolution is that it is turning most business into show business. (Page 0)
- For the first time in history, most of us have the chance to decide what to do next, what to make, how to deliver it. Most of us won’t take that chance, but it’s there. (Page 0)
- If you want access to my attention, my gratitude, and my soul, you will earn it with your emotional labor. (Page 0)
- Connection between people is always the result of emotional labor, not physical labor. The assets of trust and leadership and conversation can come only from the difficult work of creating personal art. (Page 0)
- Connection involves a complex swap of information, expectation, and culture. It involves opening ourselves to others, creating vulnerable moments that frighten us. It requires humanity and generosity, not the rearranging of digital bits. (Page 0)
### PART ONE
- When we give up control over the outcome of our interactions, we allow others to connect with us and with one another. (Page 0)
- The industrial age was about scarcity. (Page 0)
- The connection economy, on the other hand, embraces abundance. (Page 0)
- we do have an abundance of choice, an abundance of connection, and an abundance of knowledge. (Page 0)
- Connections can be made online or off, and they have value. Instead of relying on gatekeepers to block the way of those without the right degree, the right parents, or the right connections, the connection economy works horizontally—allowing anyone to stand up and make an offer. (Page 0)
- The laborer in the world of physical labor seeks opportunities to do a little bit less. Since physical labor rarely scales, a little bit less for the same pay is a great deal for the one doing the labor, a shortcut worth seeking out. (Page 0)
- In Japanese, tariki is the name for choosing to be helped, seeking a higher authority to select you, move you forward, and endorse you. (Page 0)
- Jiriki, alternatively, is self-selection, self-authorized art. Jiriki is the monkey who saves himself. (Page 0)
- The industrial economy insisted on tariki. (Page 0)
- The connection economy opens the door for jiriki. (Page 0)
- Connection begins with dignity. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[people]] [[favorite]] 
- When we humanize the person at the other end of the counter or the phone or the Internet, we grant them something precious—personhood. When we treat the people around us with dignity, we create an entirely different platform for the words we utter and the plans we make. (Page 0)
- The safe place is not the sinecure where we get a good wage from the industrialist. That’s eroding fast. The new safe place requires us to look others in the eye and see them, truly see them. (Page 0)
- The brainwashing is subtle: It doesn’t change our basic human need for safety. In fact, it uses that need to convince us that the safe place (the comfort zone) is the place where we do what we know and do what we’re told. (Page 0)
- The connection economy works because it focuses on the lonely and the bored. It works because it embraces the individual, not the mob; the weird, not the normal. (Page 0)
- it’s vital that we acknowledge that we can unteach bravery and creativity and initiative. (Page 0)
- The concept is the point, not just the craft. (Page 0)
- By separating craft from art, we gain a deeper understanding of what art means to us (Page 0)
- it’s the connection of spirit and dreams that turns the work of one person into art. (Page 0)
- Art requires the artist to care, and to care enough to do something when he knows that it might not work. (Page 0)
- Personal because it must reflect the artist. (Page 0)
- Untested because art is original. (Page 0)
- And intended to connect because art unshared is invulnerable, selfish, and ultimately pointless. (Page 0)
- The linchpin is the cornerstone of a project, the responsibility taker, the one we would miss if she were gone. (Page 0)
- Correct is fine, but it is better to be interesting. (Page 0)
- “Who do you want your customers to become?” (Page 0)
- When your work depends on something out of your control, you have given away part of your art. If your work is filled with the hope and longing for applause, it’s no longer your work—the dependence on approval in this moment has corrupted it, turned it into a process in which you are striving for ever more approval. (Page 0)
- What’s more difficult is to do the less-congratulated work of getting under someone’s skin, of changing the conversation, and of being missed when you’re gone. (Page 0)
- The connection that comes after the art is appreciated lasts far longer than applause ever could and opens the door for you to work to create ever more connection, as opposed to seeking to repeat the evanescent thrill of an ovation. (Page 0)
### PART TWO
- The opportunity is not in being momentarily popular with the anonymous masses. It’s in being missed when you’re gone, in doing work that matters to the tribe you choose.
  The old system made you popular for fitting in. The new one gives you a chance to stand out. (Page 0)
- Six Daily Habits for Artists
  Sit alone; sit quietly.
  Learn something new without any apparent practical benefit.
  Ask individuals for bold feedback; ignore what you hear from the crowd.
  Spend time encouraging other artists.
  Teach, with the intent of making change.
  Ship something that you created. (Page 0)
- The cog waits for instructions. The entrepreneur often needs an exit in sight. But the impresario takes what’s available and makes magic. (Page 0)
- The industrialist asks, “How does this threaten me?” or perhaps “How can I use this to make gradual improvements in the systems I have?” Most of all, he asks, “Is it safe?”
  The artist wonders, “How can I break this?” or “Where is there an opportunity for me to change everything and make an impact?” Most of all, the question is “Is it interesting?”
  Author Cassidy Dale points out that many people are either knights or gardeners. The knights view the world as a cataclysmic conflict with winners and losers, with battles to be fought, and with right and wrong as the dominant drivers. Gardeners, on the other hand, have the instinct to look for ways to heal, to connect, and to grow the people they encounter. (Page 0)
- The old work is machinelike.
  The new work is for mythological gods.
  Gods in charge of their destiny. Gods responsible for their choices. Gods with power and the freedom to use it.
  Us. (Page 0)
- The purpose of myths is not to have us feel separate from the gods in the stories but to have us understand that we are capable of the great feats that they perform. (Page 0)
- The Japanese term kamiwaza, like most great words for which we have no equivalent, is difficult to translate. The shortest version is “godlike.”
  When we strip away self-doubt and artifice, when we embrace initiative and art, we are left with kamiwaza. The purity of doing it properly but (Page 0)
- Better Art, Three Ways
  Fly closer to the sun.
  Become naked and vulnerable in front of those you give your art to, and
  Seek to make a connection.
  The question isn’t whether you are capable of godlike work. (You are.)
  The question is: Are you willing? (Page 0)
- On January 1, 2012, I ripped my hamstring pretty badly. More than six months later, I still don’t run or even walk with kamiwaza. Not because it hurts or because I have seriously limited range of motion (I’m lucky enough to have neither problem). No, it’s because I can’t leap. I can’t leap because part of my brain hesitates. Not for long, but just enough to move my entire body off kilter.
  This confidence, the fearlessness of forward motion without attachment to what will happen on the landing, is the signal we send to ourselves and to the world when we’re ready to do something artful. Giving up our attachment to what might happen—maybe the boss won’t like it, maybe the market will reject it, maybe my friends will think it’s stupid—is an essential part of commitment. (Page 0)
- Art is a commitment to a process and to a direction and to generosity, not to a result.
  When we make art without attachment, we’re approaching kamiwaza. (Page 0)
- This is what the powerful public speaker does. It is the work of the photographer or the coach or the teacher who is making a difference.
  Tension focuses our attention. Tension brings us closer, eager to find out how the tension will be relieved.
  It takes confidence and guts to intentionally create tension. (Page 0)
- This Might Not Work
  This is a mantra of the artist. And of course, this is where the vulnerability comes from, and the fascination. (Page 0)
- in the connection economy, it’s the person who doesn’t enter the arena who is punished. In the connection economy, the fearful are disconnected. They are the ones who are punished, not by sinking but by being isolated.
  We’ve greatly exaggerated the risk of sinking, without celebrating the value of swimming. (Page 0)
- Myths aren’t about gods (real ones or imagined). They are about us. They are about humans acting human but doing it while wearing the cloaks of gods, of legendary figures. Myths highlight the very best of ourselves (and sometimes the worst). These stories don’t spread because a king or despot insists that we hear them and memorize them. No, we engage with and remember and resonate with myths because they’re about our favorite person, our best possible self. (Page 0)
- Propaganda Is Not Myth (Page 0)
- Propaganda is a set of stories about what someone in power would like you to be. (Page 0)
- It benefits the teller, not the recipient. (Page 0)
- How do you subjugate an entire country, one of the largest on earth, with only a tiny army at your disposal? (Page 0)
- The answer was to create a set of stories and expectations that changed the culture. (Page 0)
- Attention by other people is the most irresistible of drugs. (Page 0)
- Seeking to become popular is not hardwired into human nature. What all of us seek is positive reinforcement, and our culture reinforces behaviors that we believe will make us popular. (Page 0)
- If you want to find yourself making art, set up some new habits. (Page 0)
- An impresario? Yes, someone who organizes, who invents, who creates art projects, who spins something out of nothing, using insight and connection more than money. (Page 0)
- Arnold Toynbee chronicled the dominant worldviews in dozens of civilizations over thousands of years and divided them into cultures that saw winners and losers and cultures that focused on responses to challenges instead. (Page 0)
- without self-consciousness. (Page 0)
- Until we have a humility shortage, then, the real problem is this: We continue to fly too low. We’re so afraid of demonstrating hubris, so afraid of the shame of being told we flew too high, so paralyzed by the fear that we won’t fit in, that we buy into the propaganda and don’t do what we are capable of. (Page 0)
- All the rewards for creating art are not present at its creation. That’s because the art isn’t truly art until it has connected you with another, until it has made contact and touched someone else (Page 0)
- The hubris involved in this decision is extraordinary. “Maybe this will work,” we wonder. Or even, for the particularly committed, “This might not work.” We’ve been taught that only a mythological god has the right to approach the world with that sort of confidence—confidence that no matter what happens, the journey itself was worth it. (Page 0)
- So we can’t just commit to one act of kamiwaza, one bold emotional risk, and be done with it. We have to commit to a lifetime of them. It’s a process, not an event. (Page 0)
- You don’t commit to a venue or a medium or a technique. You commit to a path and an impact. Broadway is a venue. Joy through movement is an art. When the venue doesn’t support your art, you can change it without changing your commitment to the journey. (Page 0)
- If we’re in love with the feedback and trying to manipulate the applause we get, we’ll cease to make the art we’re capable of. (Page 0)
- But if you’re going to be loved anyway, your behavior doesn’t have to be driven by your yearning for an outcome; it can be driven by something deeper. (Page 0)
- Artists can’t afford to be fragile. The work is a series of projects and problems to be solved, not a pristine, predictable environment where refined inputs lead to ever-more-refined outputs. (Page 0)
- It was easier to talk about making art than it was to actually do it. (Page 0)
- Bold doesn’t always mean bellicose or dramatic. It might merely mean connected. (Page 0)
- We’re drawn to connect with people doing art. They are us at our best. They are the new gods of our myths. (Page 0)
### PART THREE
- All industrial systems abhor grit, the unmeasurable little bits that gum up the works and make outcomes unpredictable. Digital smoothness is the antithesis of grit. Proven processes are the opposite of grit.
  Grit is our future. (Page 0)
- The one with grit, the determination to make a difference—she endures as well as the others, but then she processes that event into something that will allow her to make a bigger impact next time.
  If the grind is wearing you down, then you may be viewing the grind as the enemy, something apart from the work itself. (Page 0)
- The connection economy demands grit; it demands that things be out of true; it demands the art of imperfection because perfect is boring, not remarkable, and because defect free often means interest free.
  We don’t need more stuff; we need more humanity. (Page 0)
- Part of you (the part that bought this book, or at least decided to read it) is painfully aware of your potential. This part of your brain seeks respect, values achievement, and knows, truly knows, that you are capable of far more than you’ve done so far.
  The other part of your brain is afraid. (Page 0)
- Grit is the attitude of someone who realizes he has the power to care and is intent on doing something with it. (Page 0)
- To make art, you need to remove these three external things: (Page 0)
- Control, because external control is the factory. (Page 0)
- Motivation, because if you rely on external motivation to be your best self, then you will have ceded responsibility and authority to someone else. (Page 0)
- And approval, because the crowd is always wrong. (Page 0)
- Elements of Grit (Page 0)
- PERSEVERANCE: Many people mistake perseverance for grit. Grit includes perseverance, but it comes before the need for perseverance arrives, because grit includes goals and a passion for those goals. (Page 0)
- HARDINESS: (Page 0)
- The person with grit, on the other hand, understands that the grind is part of the work, that the grind is part of what makes the work interesting, a challenge, worth doing. If there were no grind, you’d need no grit. (Page 0)
- RESILIENCE: The dynamic process of overcoming adversity, and doing it again and again, includes both perseverance and hardiness. (Page 0)
- AMBITION: (Page 0)
- Grit exists whether or not it leads to measurable external success. Grit is its own reward. (Page 0)
- COMMITMENT: (Page 0)
- People with grit consciously set long-term goals that are difficult to attain and do not waver from these difficult goals, regardless of the presence of feedback. (Page 0)
- If you’ve sacrificed your long-term compass at the altar of instant feedback, you might enjoy some short-term achievement, but you’ve given up your grit. (Page 0)
- FLOW: (Page 0)
- What you are engrossed in isn’t nearly as important as the fact of being engrossed. (Page 0)
- Who is the self in self-control? (Page 0)
- It’s never too late to redefine self-control, to change long-ingrained habits, and to do the work you’re capable of. (Page 0)
- Blaming the system is soothing because it lets you off the hook. But when the system is broken, we wonder why you were relying on the system in the first place. (Page 0)
### Shame, Vulnerability, and Being Naked
- The problem for them is that it doesn’t matter whether or not they seek these truths. The truths will find them regardless. The economy and the culture and the market will expose these truths and then work to destroy the status quo. Sooner or later, reality wins.
  Artists never stop looking for the disturbing truth behind the facade. When reality arrives, they won’t be surprised, because they saw it coming. Sometimes they even encouraged it to come. (Page 0)
- he’s not asking for a solution; he’s asking for empathy and understanding.
  But why won’t he try to fix his problems? Perhaps they have become a crutch, a companion, perhaps a best friend for him now.
  Why not lean forward and use every tool available to take the huge steps to actually go forward?
  Because forward is risky, and forward might not work, and forward might not be better than this. (Page 0)
- Kamiwaza involves removing artifice and defense and poses from our work and boiling it down to the true essence, performing it in a way that eliminates hiding places and excuses.
  Which makes us extraordinarily vulnerable. (Page 0)
- The thing is, shame is a choice. It’s worth repeating: Shame can’t be forced on you; it must be accepted.
  The artist, then, combines courage with a fierce willingness to refuse to accept shame. Blame, sure. Shame, never.
  Where is the shame in using our best intent to make art for those we care about? (Page 0)
- He will learn nothing and will amplify his lizard brain’s certainty of his worthlessness.
  Figure out who your art is for, get better at connecting with that audience, and ignore the rest.
  Artists lead, they don’t chase. (Page 0)
- Armor prevents connection, and shame festers. The shadow of shame kills art.
  When you talk about these things, when you own them, shame starts to lose its power, and vulnerability becomes available to you again. (Page 0)
- The resistance is the shadow of art. No art, no resistance. (Page 0)
- When the resistance shows up, I know that I’m winning. Not my fight against it, but my fight to make art. (Page 0)
- Shun the nonbelievers. (Page 0)
- Your goal as an artist is to make art that moves the audience of your choice. (Page 0)
- If your efforts fail to move the audience you’ve chosen, then you should learn what worked and what didn’t and incorporate that knowledge into your next effort. Interact with the audience if it helps you learn to do better next time, but not if it gives the resistance an excuse to destroy your future art. (Page 0)
- The moment we give up our internal compass in exchange for satisfying the cultural need to follow the leader, we’ve made someone else the boss. (Page 0)
- If you’re in the business of making and strengthening connections, there isn’t just one way to do your work. (Page 0)
- The resistance is the confused and angry noise in our heads that shows up whenever we put our creativity on the line. (Page 0)
- The resistance is not something to be avoided; it’s something to seek out. (Page 0)
- The real problem when working with a consultant, a therapist, or a coach isn’t that we don’t know what to do. The real problem is that we don’t want to change our mind. (Page 0)
- Rejection says something about the critic, but not about you. (Page 0)
- Your effort is rarely correlated with how much the audience cares. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[creator_economy]] [[creative_class]] 
- Their reaction isn’t yours; it belongs to them. The art is yours. (Page 0)
### PART FIVE
- First, students need to learn to see. They have to see the world as it is, without labels, without knowing the name of what is seen.
  Second, they are taught how to make. How to use hands or voice or body to take what they see and reflect it back to the world. (Page 0)
- Our preconceptions and our fear conspire to make it difficult to see the world as it is.
  Buddhists call it prajna—accepting reality as it occurs instead of interpreting it as part of our ongoing narrative. (Page 0)
- The goal is to have so many pattern rules and so many labels and be aware of so many worldviews that they swirl together and allow you to become naive all over again.
  To be naive is to abandon your hard-earned worldview. It means seeing the world without prejudice and accepting it as it is, as opposed to the way you’re expecting it to be. (Page 0)
- And if your art isn’t generating the connection you seek . . .
  Make better art.
  See more accurately.
  Make with more precision.
  Use more guts to find your blank slate.
  And if none of those works, change your venue; find a new stage to play on.
  But don’t question your commitment. Don’t get attached to the outcome. (Page 0)
- To the industrialist, the product is the product, the transaction is the transaction. Caveat emptor. It’s yours; deal with it.
  To the artist, to the human who values outcomes and connections, caring enough to call is part of the art. (Page 0)
- The World’s Worst Boss
  That would be you.
  Even if you’re not self-employed, your boss is you. You manage your career, your day, your responses. You manage how you sell your services and your education and the way you talk to yourself.
  Odds are, you’re doing it poorly.
  If you had a manager who talked to you the way you talked to you, you’d quit. If you had a boss who wasted as much of your time as you do, she’d be fired. If an organization developed its employees as poorly as you are developing yourself, it would soon go under. (Page 0)
- We can’t rely on others to be our teachers anymore, particularly after we turn ten. No, the future belongs to individuals who decide to become great bosses (and teachers). (Page 0)
- If your work is to do art, then doing art is what you ought to be organizing your energy and your time around. Excuses aren’t welcome; the work (your work) that connects is all we are seeking. (Page 0)
- Three Insights of the Impresario
  1. If you weren’t born with talent, that’s fine. You were born with commitment.
  2. Organize the talented.
  3. Connect the disconnected. (Page 0)
- The artist may choose her audience. And if you choose an audience that understands the work, it opens the door to pushing the work even further. (Page 0)
- The Simple Reason That Creativity, Leadership, and Brainstorming Books and Courses Fail . . .
  . . . is that people don’t want them to work. We’ve been brainwashed into becoming afraid of art. (Page 0)
- Life without a bag filled with unsolved problems is a lot lighter, and you can get a lot more done. (Page 0)
- Do What You Want
  Those are the most frightening four words brought to us by the connection revolution. (Page 0)
- But there is always an alternative.
  In the idea-driven connection economy, the cost of experiments is lower than ever, the ability to coordinate is high, and the impact of being right is huge. (Page 0)
- Freedom isn’t the ability to do whatever you want. It’s the willingness to do whatever you want. (Page 0)
- The creation of art also means the fading of art, and the realization that the act of making it last forever is also the act of destroying what made it work in the first place. (Page 0)
- For the marketer, the freelancer, and the entrepreneur, the challenge is to reset your comfort level, to be okay with the undone, with the cycle of never ending.
  We were trained to finish our homework, our peas, and our chores. Today we’re never finished, and that’s okay. (Page 0)

- The Poundstone shift reminds us that those who show up are the good guys, the ones to treasure.
  “The rest of the world” isn’t nearly as important as the few who are here. (Page 0)
- “What am I hiding from? What is holding me back from offering my best work?”
  And the answer (for most of us, most of the time) is that we’re being held back by fear. The fear of being seen as a fraud. (Page 0)
- Remarkable comes from being able to risk an entirely new kind of failure, the failure that comes with a new risk. When you take the new risk, you open the door to an entirely new form of success. (Page 0)
- Our best art is strenuous. But it’s not strenuous in service of creating scarcity and of winning a finite game. It’s strenuous because it’s personal and generous.
  Infinite games bring abundance and they bring the satisfaction of creating art that matters. (Page 0)
- The game is infinite if you play it that way. You get to keep making your art as long as you are willing to make the choices that let you make your art. (Page 0)
- If you’re not prepared to cry about it, I’m not sure you’re making art.
  And if you’re not prepared to dance in anticipation, you’re definitely not making art. (Page 0)
- Art almost never works as fast as you want it to, and the more you need it to work, the slower it happens. (Page 0)
- Artists need significant reassurance that they have chosen a worthy path and that you have their back. But reassurance about the work itself must come from within.
  The best question you can ask an artist is “How is this going to work?” (Page 0)
- We’re living in a moment of time, the first moment of time, when a billion people are connected, when your work is judged (more than ever before) based on what you do rather than who you are, and when credentials, access to capital, and raw power have been dwarfed by the simple question “Do I care about what you do?”
  We built this world for you. Not so you would watch more online videos, keep up on your feeds, and LOL with your high school friends. We built it so you could do what you’re capable of. Without apology and without excuse.

- But day by day, project by project, you can train yourself to ship. (Page 0)
- the three components necessary for someone to become an artist: seeing, making, and the tabula rasa. (Page 0)
- And third, and most difficult, the artist starts with a blank slate. Art must be done for the first time, not repeated, and that first stroke, those first words—this is the source of our fear. How can we not be vulnerable when the work is ours, not that of another? (Page 0)
- The ability to see the market and the technology and the talent as it is, instead of how you want it to be (or fear it to be), is one of the secret skills of the successful creator. (Page 0)
- You can’t accurately see until you abandon your worldview. (Page 0)
- how we’re able to learn to recognize patterns. It’s not something you need to be born with; it’s something you can learn. (Page 0)
- we stop seeing patterns and start looking for shortcuts. We profile, believing our own shortcuts to be correct, and so everything gets a name. (Page 0)
- Art is the act of pointing a light at the darkness. Before you turn on the light, you have no idea what you’re about to see, and once you know what you’re going to see, it’s no longer dark. (Page 0)
- Learn to see through their eyes. (Page 0)
- Learning how to make things turns you from a spectator into a participant, from someone at the mercy of the system to someone who is helping to run the system. (Page 0)
- you need experience, the best kind of experience, the experience of repeated failure. (Page 0)
- You need the good taste to see your own work for what it is, and you earn that taste not only not by emulating those who made art before you but by failing, by repeatedly discovering what works and what doesn’t. (Page 0)
- Domain knowledge can fill us with expectation, calcify our worldview, and make it difficult to see the world as it is. But it can also fill in the blanks and enable us to understand how something works and to know enough about how to make it better. (Page 0)
- Art embraces the boundaries as levers it can use to get to the edge. (Page 0)
- Changing the way you see and changing the assumptions you bring to the audience are the shortcuts to making better art. (Page 0)
- The danger is in using someone else’s ruler to measure your art. (Page 0)
- Your Interactions Are Part of Your Art (Page 0)
- Anyone who cares and acts on it is performing a work of art. (Page 0)
- The fact that people are artists in only one part of their lives is more proof that art isn’t something you’re born with. Art is an effort, an opportunity to devote enormous emotion and energy in a specific direction. (Page 0)
- Because art carries risk and pain and effort along with it, it’s unlikely we’re going to invest in it for everything we do. The artist brings huge resources to her art, so it’s naive to believe that an artist is going to be an artist everywhere and always. (Page 0)

- Everyone should learn to write in public. (Page 0)

- If you work for the world’s worst boss, you have no one to blame but yourself. (Page 0)
- The less job you have to do, the more likely it is you’ll find the guts to make art. (Page 0)
- If you transform your job into a platform for art, you’re leveraging the trust and education and smarts you were given and putting them to good use. (Page 0)
- Without boundaries, you can’t make art. Art lives on the edge of the boundaries. (Page 0)
- Pick which rules to break, and embrace the rest. (Page 0)
- It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. (Page 0)
- Tactic: Problem and Solution Cards (Page 0)
- First, how did it feel to write down the problem? (Page 0)
- Second, how did it feel to know that the person sitting next to you was maybe, just maybe, going to write down a valid solution? (Page 0)
- And third, if the person sitting next to you failed to solve your problem adequately (which was likely, since everyone had only five minutes), were you prepared to admit that the problem was unsolvable? (Page 0)
- Tactic: The Focus Group (Page 0)
- Find exactly three other artists—who work in different fields, who come from different backgrounds, who pursue different goals—and connect with one another about the process of your art. (Page 0)
- The object is to remind you of your commitment and to push you to make your art more original, personal, and successful. (Page 0)
- The cost is that you own the results. (Page 0)
- Yes, change your tactics, and often. Agility pays. But no, don’t give up your strategy of making art. (Page 0)
- Once you acknowledge that this pain is both a signal and a marker, you don’t have to waste energy in organizing your life to make the pain go away. In fact, you can play a different game instead—figuring out how much you can stand. It’s the pain (and the fear of pain) that makes art scarce. If it were merely fun (and it can be fun!), then there’d be too much of it, and it wouldn’t be worth much. (Page 0)

- Every artist needs to wrestle with establishing limits, because without them, there’s no opportunity for leverage, for finding a new way to solve an old problem. (Page 0)

- Habits of Successful Artists (Page 0)
- if your habits are reactions and responses, if they involve processing the incoming, going to meetings, and acting on the instructions of others, you have given in to the resistance; you have sacrificed your art to the whims of others. (Page 0)
- Do you really want more of that, or is the thing you’re measuring merely a metaphor or a stand-in for something else, something more real? (Page 0)
- every time you work with someone who makes your work less than it ought to be, you’ve made a choice and you’ll need to live with the consequences. (Page 0)
- Grace Yvonne Attard writes, “I find that whenever I come from a place of scarcity and lack of faith, i.e., safe, the results of my choices always have me playing small. Choosing to lead, from the heart, from a place of serving and abundance . . . that’s almost always better.” (Page 0)

- Three Ways to Engage with the Audience (Page 0)
- Some artists willfully ignore their audience. (Page 0)
- Some artists understand that they will please only their tribe—those who are looking for the response that these artists are seeking to evoke, those who share a worldview. (Page 0)
- And some (I won’t call them artists) will eagerly listen to every criticism and work to water down the art to pander to the largest possible audience. For this person, market share means more than art does. (Page 0)
- Galumphing is the seemingly useless elaboration and ornamentation of activity. (Page 0)

- What Every Artist Needs (Page 0)
- Don’t question the commitment to the mission. (Page 0)
- don’t question the tactics (Page 0)
- it’s totally appropriate to ask your artist if she wants to discuss how to improve the chances that her audience will understand her art better. (Page 0)
- Reassurance is futile. (Page 0)
- Part of supporting the mission is pushing the artist to be more committed, not less, pushing for more focus and edge and weirdness, not less (Page 0)
- No, it doesn’t all work, but you always get to dance. Win or lose, you get to play. I would tell myself not to put so much emotional baggage on every project and every interaction. The goal is to keep playing, not to win. (Page 0)
- The biggest black mark on your working résumé is the road not taken, the project not initiated, and the art not made. (Page 0)
