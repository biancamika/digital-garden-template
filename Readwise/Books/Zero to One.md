## Highlights
### 1. The Challenge of the Future
- the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. (Page 0)
- The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. (Page 0)
- Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology. (Page 0)
- In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable. (Page 0)
- New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups. (Page 0)
- a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. (Page 0)
### 2. Party Like It’s 1999
- Make incremental advances (Page 0)
- Stay lean and flexible (Page 0)
- Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation. (Page 0)
- Improve on the competition (Page 0)
- Focus on product, not sales (Page 0)
- 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
  2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
  3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
  4. Sales matters just as much as product. (Page 0)
- how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself. (Page 0)
### 3. All Happy Companies Are Different
- Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create. (Page 0)
- capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. (Page 0)
- if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business. (Page 0)
- If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors—maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great-grandmother’s recipe—your business is unlikely to survive.
  Creative industries work this way, too. (Page 0)
- Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets (Page 0)
- Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets: (Page 0)
- In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits. (Page 0)
- Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. (Page 0)
- Monopoly is the condition of every successful business. (Page 0)
- All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. (Page 0)
### 4. The Ideology of Competition
- But really it’s competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive. (Page 0)
- According to Marx, people fight because they are different. (Page 0)
- To Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. (Page 0)
### 5. Last Mover Advantage
- the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. (Page 0)
- Technology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money for the first few years: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue. (Page 0)
- you can hit those numbers and still overlook deeper, harder-to-measure problems that threaten the durability of your business. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[business]] 
- will this business still be around a decade from now? Numbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business. (Page 0)
- Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. (Page 0)
- proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. (Page 0)
- Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it. (Page 0)
- Network effects can be powerful, but you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small. (Page 0)
- A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales. (Page 0)
- Service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. (Page 0)
- A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. (Page 0)
- No technology company can be built on branding alone. (Page 0)
- Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. (Page 0)
- The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. (Page 0)
- Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets (Page 0)
- Originally, “disruption” was a term of art to describe how a firm can use new technology to introduce a low-end product at low prices, improve the product over time, and eventually overtake even the premium products offered by incumbent companies using older technology (Page 0)
- But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create. (Page 0)
- “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. (Page 0)
### 6. You Are Not a Lottery Ticket
- to be a monopoly of one. (Page 0)
- But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself. (Page 0)
- Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[business]] 
- The philosophy of the ancient world was pessimistic: (Page 0)
- Modern philosophers have been mostly optimistic. (Page 0)
- philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future. (Page 0)
- progress without planning is what we call “evolution.” (Page 0)
- Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best. (Page 0)
- A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random. (Page 0)
- A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. (Page 0)
### 7. Follow the Money
- in venture capital, where investors try to profit from exponential growth in early-stage companies, a few companies attain exponentially greater value than all others. (Page 0)
- a small handful of companies radically outperform all others. (Page 0)
- everybody is an investor. (Page 0)
- investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible. (Page 0)
- But life is not a portfolio: not for a startup founder, and not for any individual. An entrepreneur cannot “diversify” herself (Page 0)
### 8. Secrets
- in order to be happy, every individual “needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.” He divided human goals into three groups:
  1. Goals that can be satisfied with minimal effort;
  2. Goals that can be satisfied with serious effort; and
  3. Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes. (Page 0)
- Along with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends have conspired to root out belief in secrets. First is incrementalism. (Page 0)
- Second is risk aversion. (Page 0)
- Third is complacency. (Page 0)
- Fourth is “flatness.” (Page 0)
- If insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain many great companies still to start. (Page 0)
- There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. (Page 0)
- So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you? (Page 0)
- every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator. (Page 0)
### 9. Foundations
- a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. (Page 0)
- As a founder, your first job is to get the first things right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation. (Page 0)
- Technical abilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much. (Page 0)
- Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity?
  • Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?
  • Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs? (Page 0)
- A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held. (Page 0)
- If you want an effective board, keep it small. (Page 0)
- everyone you involve with your company should be involved full-time. (Page 0)
- For people to be fully committed, they should be properly compensated. (Page 0)
- high cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it already exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future. (Page 0)
- Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future. (Page 0)
- Equity can’t create perfect incentives, but it’s the best way for a founder to keep everyone in the company broadly aligned. (Page 0)
- only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future. (Page 0)
- The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is most characteristic of beginnings. (Page 0)
- it lasts as long as a company is creating new things, and it ends when creation stops. (Page 0)
### 10. The Mechanics of Mafia
- no company has a culture; every company is a culture. A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside. (Page 0)
- Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms. (Page 0)
- there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. (Page 0)
- everyone at your company should be different in the same way—a tribe of like-minded people fiercely devoted to the company’s mission. (Page 0)
- defining roles reduced conflict. (Page 0)
- But every company is also its own ecosystem, and factional strife makes it vulnerable to outside threats. (Page 0)
- People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed. (Page 0)
### 11. If You Build It, Will They Come?
- But advertising doesn’t exist to make you buy a product right away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. (Page 0)
- none of us wants to be reminded when we’re being sold. (Page 0)
- “path dependence”: specific historical circumstances independent of objective quality can determine which products enjoy widespread adoption (Page 0)
- It’s better to think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no matter how good the product. (Page 0)
- If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. (Page 0)
- In general, the higher the price of your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale—and the more it makes sense to spend it. (Page 0)
- distribution follows a power law of its own. (Page 0)
- Your company needs to sell more than its product. You must also sell your company to employees and investors. (Page 0)
- Everybody has a product to sell—no matter whether you’re an employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your company consists of just you and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson. (Page 0)
### 12. Man and Machine
- computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete. (Page 0)
- Globalization Means Substitution (Page 0)
- Technology Means Complementarity (Page 0)
- The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people. We don’t trade with computers any more than we trade with livestock or lamps. And that’s the point: computers are tools, not rivals. (Page 0)
- But the most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems? (Page 0)
- As we find new ways to use computers, they won’t just get better at the kinds of things people already do; they’ll help us to do what was previously unimaginable. (Page 0)
### 13. Seeing Green
- 1. The Engineering Question
  Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
  2. The Timing Question
  Is now the right time to start your particular business?
  3. The Monopoly Question
  Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
  4. The People Question
  Do you have the right team?
  5. The Distribution Question
  Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
  6. The Durability Question
  Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
  7. The Secret Question
  Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see? (Page 0)
- Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user. (Page 0)
- But you can’t dominate a submarket if it’s fictional, and huge markets are highly competitive, not highly attainable. (Page 0)
- selling and delivering a product is at least as important as the product itself. (Page 0)
- what will the world look like 10 and 20 years from now, and how will my business fit in? (Page 0)
- Each of the casualties had described their bright futures using broad conventions on which everybody agreed. (Page 0)
- Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see. (Page 0)
- if something is “socially good,” is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society? (Page 0)
- Progress isn’t held back by some difference between corporate greed and nonprofit goodness; instead, we’re held back by the sameness of both. Just as corporations tend to copy each other, nonprofits all tend to push the same priorities. (Page 0)
- Doing something different is what’s truly good for society—and it’s also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve. (Page 0)
- No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company. (Page 0)
- But a valuable business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market. (Page 0)
### 14. The Founder’s Paradox
- Normally we expect opposite traits to be mutually exclusive: a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at the same time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders (Page 0)
- A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short time horizons. (Page 0)
- individual prominence and adulation can never be enjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety and demonization at any moment—so be careful. (Page 0)
- Founders are important not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather because a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company. (Page 0)
### Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity?
- The ancients saw all of history as a neverending alternation between prosperity and ruin. (Page 0)
- Conventional wisdom seems to assume instead that the whole world will converge toward a plateau of development similar to the life of the richest countries today. (Page 0)
- The most dramatic version of this outcome is called the Singularity, an attempt to name the imagined result of new technologies so powerful as to transcend the current limits of our understanding. (Page 0)
- Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future. (Page 0)
