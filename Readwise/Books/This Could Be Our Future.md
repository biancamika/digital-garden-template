## Highlights
### INTRODUCTION
- “financial maximization.” The belief that in any decision, the right choice is whichever option makes the most money. (Page 0)
- Financial maximization has trapped us with three assumptions: (1) that the point of life is to maximize financial wealth, (2) that we’re individuals trapped in an adversarial world, and (3) that this situation is inevitable and eternal. (Page 0)
- end financial maximization’s reign as the primary driver of human activity by expanding our idea of value. (Page 0)
- The law of compounding interest says a small amount of change adds up each year, gaining momentum as it grows. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER ONE: A SIMPLE IDEA
- But the more you talk about something, the more you learn what works about it and what doesn’t. (Page 0)
- Execution is a critical gap between idea and reality, but it’s not the only one. Another is belief. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER TWO: THE NO-LEFT-TURN RULE
- The no-left-turn rule is an example of a hidden default. An unseen influence on our behavior. Hidden defaults are subtle nudges that guide us (Page 0)
- Financial maximization says that in any decision, the rational choice is the one that makes the most money. (Page 0)
- GDP makes no assessment of the money’s larger implications, only how much of it there is. (Page 0)
- Game theory became a tool for a new kind of “hyperrational” way of thinking. A view that, among other things, teaches the rationality of maximizing one’s self-interest. (Page 0)
- Part of it comes down to just what we call it. That’s how powerful hidden defaults can be. (Page 0)
- These hidden defaults even determine what we perceive as fact. We think we make decisions based on objective truth, but all of us follow norms and defaults set by the cultural narratives we live within. (Page 0)
- Not only do we perceive hidden defaults as how things are, we see them as how they should be. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER THREE: WHY EVERYTHING IS THE SAME
- “Too much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists, but too few.” (Page 0)
- When they make prestige TV they’re not financially maximizing, they’re reputationally maximizing. Their goal is to impress. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER FOUR: THE MULLET ECONOMY
- There are two steps to the Mullet Economy.
  Step one is for companies to cut costs through wage freezes, layoffs, and service reductions. This is the business-in-front part of the mullet. This is what the Maximizing Class advises companies to do.
  Step two is to redistribute the “saved” cash to executives and shareholders. This ensures that management gets “buy-in” (one of those phrases that accidentally tells the truth) with the board, shareholders, and public markets. This is the party in back. (Page 0)
- True believers in the Friedman doctrine, the Maximizing Class represented a new force in business and society with one single goal: to maximize profitability.8 (Page 0)
- Once the goal became financial maximization, money called the shots. Everyone else got in line. Only the Maximizing Class and their overseers had decision-making privileges. (Page 0)
- The Maximizing Class’s strategy is like the mullet, only economic. Cost-cutting/business in front for most of the population, and financial windfalls/party in back for the top 10 percent. One group’s earnings and influence get cut while the other’s grows. That’s the Mullet Economy. (Page 0)
- a shareholder-centric economy is, practically speaking, a wealth-centric economy. (Page 0)
- The problem here isn’t shareholders being wealthy or investors benefiting from their investments. The problem is workers have a direct hand in the success of these companies, and yet they’ve been rewarded with frozen wages and mass layoffs. (Page 0)
- The rewards of our economy are bypassing workers and going straight to shareholders on top, while the costs bypass shareholders and fall on the shoulders of everyone else. (Page 0)
- Politics is the explicit competition to determine society’s norms and rules. (Page 0)
- PHASE 1: THE END OF COMPETITION (Page 0)
- PHASE 2: MASS LAYOFFS (Page 0)
- PHASE 3: EXTRACT AND DISTRIBUTE (Page 0)
- Financial maximization is a never-ending search for costs to cut and value to extract. Even in periods of success, its only move is to downsize people and redistribute money to shareholders. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER FIVE: THE TRAP
- In everyday business vernacular: Destroy the competition. Poach employees. Capture a market. Make a killing.
  This kind of language had nothing to do with building a strong organization, making good decisions, or improving the status quo. Just the opposite. This was language of violence, conquest, and war. (Page 0)
- Achieving “profit goals,” as researchers called them, was less satisfying than achieving “purpose goals.” (Page 0)
- companies follow the path of least resistance—big money, growth at all costs, act now and think about the consequences never—before getting trapped by their choices down the line. (Page 0)
- Don’t hate the player, hate the game. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER SIX: WHAT’S REALLY VALUABLE?
- The argument against financial maximization is that while it makes some people much richer, it can also create financial instability for many more people at the same time.
  The case against financial maximization isn’t anti-money. It’s pro-money. It’s just pro-people, too. In service of people, money can be a very positive force. But when we live our lives serving money—by choice or because we have no choice—we severely limit our potential. (Page 0)
- Pink names three drives that he believes speak to our higher values. Pink identifies:
  Autonomy: the desire to have a say over what we do
  Mastery: the process of getting better at what we do
  Purpose: the meaning behind what we do (Page 0)
- Value means money. Value is an economics word.
  Values means ideals. Values is a humanities word.
  Value is a form of measurement. Values are a form of categorization. One is quantitative and the other is qualitative. Both relate to the goodness or importance of things. (Page 0)
- Happiness didn’t keep going up with a person’s salary at the same rate. (Page 0)
- Because the more you have of something, the less more of it means to you. Once a person has satisfied his or her financial security, being “more financially secure” doesn’t make as meaningful a difference. Economists call this phenomenon “diminishing returns.” (Page 0)
- researchers found that people were more effective or more generous when money was not involved. Once money entered the picture, people didn’t perform as well. They became guarded. They didn’t want to lose. (Page 0)
- In many situations, money can be a demotivating force. (Page 0)
- Money as the basis of life and society sets a ceiling on what we can be. It doesn’t inspire our best selves. It doesn’t aim for the peak of the pyramid. (Page 0)
- For the past hundred years we’ve measured value through a metric called gross domestic product (GDP). GDP tracks how much money businesses, consumers, and the government spend each quarter in a given country. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[economics]] 
- GDP tracks how much money is spent but not how or why it’s spent. (Page 0)
- But when our only concept of value is financial, there’s cognitive dissonance between how people want to live and how our metrics want us to live. (Page 0)
- the reality of value is already beyond our measurement systems. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER SEVEN: BENTOISM
- The goal of Bentoism is to help us find the proper values and ways of valuing in all that we do. (Page 0)
- Now Me is about the here and now. This is life as we know it today. In Now Me the governing values are security, pleasure, and autonomy. (Page 0)
- Now Us is a space for our relationships and interactions with others. In Now Us the governing values are community, fairness, and tradition. (Page 0)
- Future Me is about our legacy and personal values. In Future Me the governing values are mastery, purpose, and grit (Page 0)
- Future Us is about the world that future generations will experience. In Future Us, the governing values are awareness, sustainability, and knowledge. (Page 0)

- There were three driving forces, ones that are often present in times of great progress. (Page 0)
- technology (Page 0)
- measurement (Page 0)
- specificity (Page 0)
- Financial maximization is to value what bloodletting was to medicine: the most advanced answer of its time, but not the final answer. Value-wise, we’re still in the Dark Ages. We’ve barely scratched the surface. We don’t yet know what we don’t yet know. (Page 0)
- Bentoism is like a rudimentary microscope for value. A way of going from 1x to 4x the magnification. With a broader view, the same forces that deepened our understanding of health can deepen our understanding of value. Our ability to create value can significantly expand as a result. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER NINE: HOW TO DO A PERFECT HANDSTAND
- “Most people,” he said, “think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting.” Unrealistic beliefs on scope—often hidden and undiscussed—kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be. (Page 0)
- We tend to assume that what’s new must be improved. That technology means progress. (Page 0)
- New can mean better and technology can create progress. But those things don’t automatically go together. (Page 0)
### CHAPTER TEN: VALUES MAXIMIZING CLASS
- After close examination of hundreds of case studies, researchers identified three primary paths to growing value:
  Growing new value in new things
  Growing new value in existing things
  Growing existing value in existing things (Page 0)
- For all the challenges we face, we’re equipped with profound tools. The collective wisdom and values that have been passed down by our ancestors’ hard work and experience. The institutions built by previous generations. The technologies and skills we’ve developed.
  To take advantage of these tools, we must live up to our responsibilities as humans. We must be conscious of the continuous process that keeps our cultures and values alive. We must be vigilant and aware of our role. Every single one of us has a part to play. (Page 0)
- Expanding Bentoist values in partnership with organizations brings together the best of both worlds: the collaborative urgency of companies and the generative promise of value creation. This is the coprosperity that the world needs. (Page 0)
- Nonfinancial value is a good financial investment. (Page 0)
- The Values Helix is a natural force propelled by time that carries our values, our customs, and even our hidden defaults across generations. The choices we collectively and individually make and the lives we live get swooped up by the Values Helix and directly affect the values of the generations that follow. (Page 0)
### APPENDIX
- Walzer’s vision is a world without dominance. A world where each sphere of life is ruled by its own values, not dominated by others. Because, as Walzer writes, “We are all culture-producing creatures whose customs have meaning and any attempts to override them are tyrannical.” (Page 0)
