## Highlights
- How many people benefit, and by how much?
  Is this the most effective thing you can do?
  Is this area neglected?
  What would have happened otherwise?
  What are the chances of success, and how good would success be?
- We very often fail to think as carefully about helping others as we could, mistakenly believing that applying data and rationality to a charitable endeavor robs the act of virtue. And that means we pass up opportunities to make a tremendous difference.
- the charity world often lacks appropriate feedback mechanisms.
- 100x Multiplier. For those of us living in rich countries, you should expect to be able to do at least one hundred times as much to benefit other people as you can to benefit yourself.
- Valuing one action over another is difficult both psychologically and practically, but it is not impossible. In order to make comparisons between actions, we need to ask: How many people benefit, and by how much?
- We can overcome this problem by thinking in terms of improving lives rather than in terms of intermediate metrics like number of schoolbooks provided. In order to truly make comparisons between different actions, we need to measure impact in terms of the size of the benefits we confer through those actions.
- quality-adjusted life year, or QALY
- The idea behind the QALY is that there are two ways you can give a health benefit to someone. First, you can “save someone’s life.” (I use quotes here because “saving” a life, of course, only ever means extending someone’s life.) The second way to benefit someone is to improve the quality of their life during the time they are alive.
- If we want to do as much good as we can, we need to think about what the consequences of our actions will be. Moreover, we need to think about how our actions will turn into improvements to people’s lives
- We need to ensure we’re making not just a difference but the most difference we can.
- thinking at the margin: assessing the value of an additional thing—what is known in economics as its marginal utility—rather than thinking about the average value of that thing.
- value diminishes as their quantity increases.
- law of diminishing returns.
- We’re about one hundred times richer than the poorest billion people in the world, and we can do several hundred times more to help them than we can to help others in the rich countries we live in.
- assessing the average value of a doctor.
- Simple View.
- if a social program is going to be rolled out on a large scale, then it should have been proven to be effective first.
- Earning to give means exactly what it sounds like: rather than trying to maximize the direct impact you have with your job, you instead try to increase your earnings so you can donate more, improving people’s lives through your giving rather than your day-to-day work
- expected value.
- Maximizing expected value is generally regarded as the best strategy for making decisions when you know the value and the probabilities of each option.
- Because the social problems in the world are so big, additional resources directed to them diminish in value very slowly.

- But when thinking “merely” in terms of millions of dollars, one can often assume the altruistic value of money stays the same no matter how much of it you have.
- Public health experts use the concept of a “micromort” to compare the risks, where one micromort equals a one-in-a-million chance of dying, equivalent to thirty minutes of expected life lost if you’re aged twenty, or fifteen minutes of expected life lost if you’re aged fifty.
- In just the same way, when trying to do good, we need to be sensitive both to the likelihood of success and to the value of that success. This means that low-probability high-payoff activities can take priority over sure bets of more modest impact.
- The chance of you being the person who makes the difference is very small, but if you do make the difference, it will be very large indeed.
- lower-bound reasoning: given that it’s impossible to get a precise estimate of her potential impact in politics, we’ll try to create an estimate that we feel confident is an underestimate (or a “lower bound”).
- Black Swans: very rare events that have a very great impact.
- The first thing to explore is whether there’s high-quality evidence regarding the impact of the program that the charity implements.
- What does this charity do?
- How cost-effective is each program area?
- How robust is the evidence behind each program?
- How well is each program implemented?
- Does the charity need additional funds?
- Where it becomes crucial, however, is when people are encouraged to do fairly ineffective acts of altruism and, as a result, are less likely to perform effective ones later. If, for example, encouraging someone to buy fair-trade causes that person to devote less time or money to other, more effective activities, then promoting fair-trade might on balance be harmful.
- low-wage, labor-intensive manufacturing is a stepping-stone that helps an economy based around cash crops develop into an industrialized, richer society.
- The correct response is to try to end the extreme poverty that makes sweatshops desirable places to work in the first place.

- moral licensing, which describes how people who perform one good action often compensate by doing fewer good actions in the future.
- Moral licensing shows that people are often more concerned about looking good or feeling good rather than actually doing good.
- But the brain is a malleable organ. Every time you do an activity, or have a thought, you are changing a piece of yourself into something slightly different than it was before. Every hour you spend with others, you become more like the people around you.
  Gradually, you become a different person. If there is a large gap between your daily conduct and your core commitment, you will become more like your daily activities and less attached to your original commitment.
- Why hasn’t this problem been solved by markets?
  Why hasn’t this problem been solved by the state?
  Why hasn’t this problem already been solved by philanthropy?
- How do I personally fit with this job?
- What’s my impact while I’m working at this job?
- How does this job contribute to my impact later on in life?
- Independence
- Sense of completion
- Variety
- Feedback from the job
- Contribution
- Spending a few years building your abilities now, therefore, can pay off with increased impact over a much longer period.
- you should focus on building up skills, network, and credentials, rather than trying to have an impact right away.
- Through your initial work, you develop “career capital”—skills, a network, and credentials—which will help you take a higher-impact job later on.
- First is how well it keeps your options open.
- Second, there is “exploration value”: How much do you learn about what careers you should choose in the future in the course of doing the job?
- entrepreneurs should think of their ideas or products like hypotheses, and continually test, ultimately letting the potential customers determine what the product should be.
- Instead of trying to work out what your calling is and then forming a rigid plan on the basis of that calling, you should think like a scientist, testing hypotheses. This has three implications.
- Rather than having a fixed career plan, try to have a career “model”—a set of provisional goals and hypotheses that you’re constantly revising as you get new evidence or opportunities.
- In general, jobs that require social skills (like public relations), creativity (like fashion design), or precise perception and manipulation (like boilermaking) are the least likely to become automated.
- Jobs that require physical proximity or high levels of training are also unlikely to be outsourced.
- First, scale.
- Second, neglectedness.
- Third, tractability.
- Personal fit.
- 1: Establish a habit of regular giving.
- 2: Write down a plan for how you’re going to incorporate effective altruism into your life.
- 3: Join the effective altruism community.
- 4: Tell others about effective altruism.
