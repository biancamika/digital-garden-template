## Highlights
### Understand How Wealth Is Created
- build your character in a certain way, then your character becomes your destiny. (Page 0)
- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. (Page 0)
- Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. (Page 0)
- You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. (Page 0)
- All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. (Page 0)
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. (Page 0)
- Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for (Page 0)
- Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion (Page 0)
- When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, (Page 0)
- Capital and labor are permissioned leverage (Page 0)
- Code and media are permissionless leverage. (Page 0)
- Productize Yourself (Page 0)
- So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. (Page 0)
- Escape competition through authenticity (Page 0)
- The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets. (Page 0)
- The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. (Page 0)

- when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you’ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all-in and forget about the rest. (Page 0)
- three broad classes of leverage: (Page 0)
- One form of leverage is labor (Page 0)
- Money is good as a form of leverage. (Page 0)
- “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. (Page 0)
- Knowledge workers function like athletes—train and sprint, then rest and reassess. (Page 0)
- Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. (Page 0)
- Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there’s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing. To me, creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it’s fun, because I’m into the product. (Page 0)
- You created your own luck. You put yourself in a position to capitalize on luck or to attract luck when nobody else created the opportunity for themselves. To get rich without getting lucky, we want to be deterministic. We don’t want to leave it to chance. (Page 0)
- “Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.” (Page 0)
- You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in this world is not having self-esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will? (Page 0)
- you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you. (Page 0)
### Building Judgment
- You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money.
  You get rich by saving your time to make money. (Page 0)
### Judgment
- If you have two choices to make, and they’re relatively equal choices, take the path more difficult and more painful in the short term. (Page 0)
- So you generally want to lean into things with short-term pain, but long-term gain. (Page 0)
- When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution. (Page 0)
    - Tags: [[philosophy]] 
- Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. (Page 0)
- The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. (Page 0)
- Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality. (Page 0)
- The problem isn’t reality. The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say (Page 0)
- creating identities and labels locks you in and keeps you from seeing the truth. (Page 0)
- There are two attractive lessons about suffering in the long term. It can make you accept the world the way it is. The other lesson is it can make your ego change in an extremely hard way. (Page 0)
- For important decisions, discard memory and identity, and focus on the problem. (Page 0)
- praise specifically, criticize generally. (Page 0)
- If you have a criticism of someone, then don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities. If you have to praise somebody, then always try and find the person who is the best example of what you’re praising and praise the person, specifically. (Page 0)
- A lousy way to do memory prediction is “X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future.” It’s too based on specific circumstances. What you want is principles. You want mental models. (Page 0)
- The brain space is finite—you have finite neurons—so you can almost think of these as pointers, addresses, or mnemonics to help you remember deep-seated principles where you have the underlying experience to back it up. (Page 0)
- Mental models are really just compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge. (Page 0)
- I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It’s not about having correct judgment. It’s about avoiding incorrect judgm (Page 0)
- the principal-agent problem is the single most fundamental problem in microeconomics. (Page 0)
- if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don’t care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal’s assets. (Page 0)
- The less you feel like an agent, the better the job you’re going to do. (Page 0)
- You’re biologically not built to realize how many choices there are. (Page 0)
- When you choose something, you get locked in for a long time. (Page 0)
- It’s very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain. (Page 0)
- When it comes to reading, make sure your foundation is very, very high quality. (Page 0)
- The best way to have a high-quality foundation (you may not love this answer), but the trick is to stick to science and to stick to the basics. (Page 0)
### Learning Happiness
- happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life. (Page 0)

- Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive. (Page 0)
- How do you learn to accept things you can’t change?
  Fundamentally, it boils down to one big hack: embracing death. (Page 0)
- happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. (Page 0)
- the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don’t even play the game, who rise above it. (Page 0)
- Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. (Page 0)
- One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous. (Page 0)
- peace and happiness are skills. (Page 0)
- The more you judge, the more you separate yourself. (Page 0)
- The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. (Page 0)
- You always have three options: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you could leave it but not leaving it and not accepting it. (Page 0)
### Choosing to Be Yourself
- Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don’t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You’re never going to be them. You’ll never be good at being somebody else. (Page 0)
- We evolved for scarcity but live in abundance (Page 0)
- most of our suffering comes from avoidance. (Page 0)
- The mind itself is a muscle—it can be trained and conditioned. (Page 0)
- Impatience with actions, patience with results (Page 0)
### The Meanings of Life
- You’re dying and being reborn at every moment. It’s up to you whether to forget or remember that. (Page 0)
### Bonus
- The democratization of technology allows anyone to be a creator, entrepreneur, scientist. The future is brighter. (Page 0)
