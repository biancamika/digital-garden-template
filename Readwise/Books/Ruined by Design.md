## Highlights
- Empathy is a pretty word for exclusion.
- They are not edge cases. They are human beings, and we owe them our best work.
- A designer seeks to build their professional community, not divide it.
- “The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.”
- An algorithm is not a spine.
- “You may be hiring us and that may be your name on the check, but we do not work for you. We’re coming in to solve a problem, because we believe it needs to be solved and it’s worth solving. But we work for the people being affected by that problem. Our job is to look out for them because they’re not in the room. And we will under no circumstances design anything that puts those people at risk.”
- We’re no longer pushing pixels around a screen. We’re building complex systems that touch people’s lives, destroy their personal relationships, broadcast words of both support and hate, and undeniably mess with their mental health.
- when designing something, imagine that your relationship to that system gets determined after you’ve made it.
- a veil of ignorance is a way of determining whether what you’re designing, be it a startup, a dinner plan, or a system of government, is just.
- There is no such thing as neutral software. We all bring our own biases to the things we design—our own ethical code, and our own garbage.
- What we need to worry about isn’t unethical industries. It’s unethical decisions made over time because of ill-conceived motivations.
- Cooperation and regret is noted, but it doesn’t excuse the conduct.
- What all of these people had in common was a well-rounded curiosity, the good sense to know when something wasn’t working, and good social skills. Not only could they design well, they could write, think analytically; and they were curious about every job in the shop.
- They lacked a basic understanding of how businesses work, how to research a problem, how to measure the impact of their work, how to present work effectively, and how to take criticism. Not to mention basic shit like how to charge for their work or write an invoice. More importantly, they seemed to lack a curiosity about these things.
- Learning how to practice that craft in a way that keeps designers out of jail, and society from burning down, is your new success metric for education.
- It takes knowing what questions to ask. It takes knowing how to test the effects of the product. It takes knowing how to build a good argument. And it takes seeing yourself as an equal stakeholder in the product. It takes seeing yourself as a gatekeeper.
- I’ve interviewed design school graduates who couldn’t write an introductory email, don’t know how to talk about their work, who cried when I gave them feedback, who had too narrow a definition of design (I’ll only do these things!), and who couldn’t name three designers they admired.
- The biggest problem, by far, is they confuse solving design problems with personal expression.
- Anyone who wants a career as a designer is going to need to speak about someone’s business and organizational goals. They’re going to have to learn how to analyze data, and how to measure effectiveness. They’re going to have to learn how to build and extend brands and to do goal-driven work. Most of all, they need to learn how to measure the effectiveness of their own work. Not only for the company, but more importantly for society at large.
- I’ve seen plenty of creative people’s careers derail because they couldn’t manage their shit. They couldn’t present their work effectively. They couldn’t speak about project goals. They couldn’t elicit or respond to feedback. They didn’t know to ask why, and they were afraid to say no.
- The best place to do good work is right there where you are standing.
- You work for the people who’ll ultimately come in contact with your work. You work for the people who aren’t in the room.
- “why are you making this?
- If you care about working ethically, it is imperative that you understand how your company makes money, because your labor is going to be used to help them do it. The second question we ask all of our clients after “why are you making this?” is “how does this make money?”
- In my experience, fear of doing research is always about ego and fear, which is a horrible combination. If you have a good idea, you should be happy that someone is willing to kick the tires on it.
- Ask the person how it’s broken. Keep digging until you get to the root of what the problem is, and then fix it.
- Ultimately, the success we crave isn’t our own. It’s the success of the people we work for.
- Twitter works like a giant depressed brain. It can’t tell right from wrong, and it can’t tell big from small.
- When your entire system for enforcing violation relies on users policing themselves, you’re not doing your job responsibly.
- Overton window, which describes what we’re willing to discuss or tolerate over time
- To design is to influence people. To design is to build new connections in people’s minds. To design is to build relationships where there previously weren’t any.
- To design is to influence.
- If you want to have a say in what’s being designed you need to be in the room where design decisions are being made. By design decisions, I mean things like metrics, strategy, outcomes, definitions, timelines, and resources. All of those things will influence what is being designed a million times more than where pixels ultimately get placed.
- There’s a metaphor used in journalism called the inverted pyramid. In short, you give the most important information at the very beginning, increase the details as, or if, the reader continues reading the article, and then finish up with relevant background.
- They want to be listened to and respected.
- I embed myself by becoming the warp to people’s weft.”
- People make decisions based on feelings and emotion more than they make decisions based on data.
- If you’re not persuading people, you’re not telling a good enough story.
- The problem here isn’t someone making an unethical decision, although they are. The problem is the system which puts a worker in that position.
- The promise of the internet was that it was going to give voice to the voiceless, visibility to the invisible, and power to the powerless.
- Let those that come after us sift through the ashes to learn from our mistakes.
- Don’t be a cog in their machine. Not when we can use all those cogs to build our own machine!
- When people start dying, we regulate industries and we license practitioners.
- regulations encourage innovation. They give us the constraints we need around which to design solutions.
- Design is the solution to a problem, but that problem is never your self-esteem.
- If we want positive search results, we should do positive things. If we want to reassure the users of our products that they can trust us, we should do positive things.
- Community breeds standards; standards breed accountability; accountability breeds trust; licensure validates that trust.
- As long as you are a designer, you have a responsibility to make the world better for the rest of humanity. If you are a designer, you are a human being first.
