## Highlights
- In a speculative design setting, designers create artifacts and prototypes meant to provoke thought and reflection. Speculative design operates on a more conceptual and philosophical level, by inviting us to question how new technologies might alter our everyday lives, and how they might impact our futures.

- The core question asked within speculative design is, “What if…?”
  With speculative design, we start by asking, Is this a good idea? Before asking, How do we make it happen?
  Speculative design aims to provoke thought about our current world, and our possible futures, through the lense of technology.

- Futures are central to speculative design. Within this context, the future is seen as a range of possibilities. Futures can be characterized as probable, plausible, possible, and impossible, depending on the likelihood of it occurring.

- A time horizon of ten years (the near future) is considered ideal for speculative design.

- Despite its theoretical nature, speculative design relies on thorough research and analysis. In order to avoid pure speculation, plausible scenarios must be built upon a strong body of well-researched evidence. This can be developed by following evidence-based trends over time, or by examining how certain events have played out in history.

- Speculative design also borrows practices from contemporary art, such as the use of objects for social commentary, rather than for commercial or functional purposes.

- Breaking away from this trend, speculative design looks toward literature and contemporary art for inspiration. From literature, it borrows techniques for crafting fictional narrative, as well as literary devices for keeping readers immersed in a make-believe world. Like literature, speculative design is also a way to explore human nature, constrained only by what’s possible through language.
