## Highlights
- To be a “creator,” then, implies some sort of romantic entanglement with the spiritual, a reckoning with the ineffable holy spirit.
- The endless pressure to publish in order to maintain social capital creates perverse incentives,
- The best articulation I’ve found is that research is about uncovering a problem, testing a hypothesis, trying to learn something that no one else has before.
- In other words, it’s goal-oriented. If you are successful, the world pushes forward a little bit more; civilization discovers something, however small, that it didn’t know before.
- Is being a creator like research — directed towards some deeper aspiration — or is it like reading books all day: in other words, entertainment? If it’s the latter, what does it mean to glorify the indefinite pursuit of creation?
- This is also known as the nonprofit industrial complex: what starts out as a worthy endeavor eventually becomes about self-preservation of the ideal.
- “creator industrial complex.”
- If you’re obligated to create something every day, rather than when it feels right, you’ll start putting things out there that aren’t very interesting in order to fill the space. Like the nonprofit, preserving the “creator” identity matters more than what is accomplished. []
- Content is a means to an end, but it shouldn’t be the end goal.
- I’d hate to see “being a creator” become synonymous with entertainment, where people are never intrinsically motivated to explore any of its potential beyond that.
- Without any deeper purpose in mind, aspiring to be a “creator,” as a career move, is almost tautologically devoid of cultural meaning and impact.
- When I imagine a cultural renaissance that inspires me, I think about working together to address unsolved questions, tugging on threads in conversations that need unraveling, creating enduring artifacts for generations to pore over and iterate upon.
- The “publish or perish” model that nudges people to rack up more followers is not the pinnacle of creative freedom; it’s indentured spiritual servitude.
- We believe on a surface level that “creating” is a divine form of self-expression that carries intrinsic public value. We should work harder to imbue it with something more.
