## Highlights
- Accurate feedback means that it reliably tells you when you do something right.

- An inaccurate feedback loop means that the results of the evaluation phase are “noisy” and contain significant variance, so the next assessment cycle will need to take that into account.

- A tight feedback loop means that feedback about the results of your choices are both accurate and fast

- The shorter and more accurate the feedback loop, the easier it is to learn.

- Tight feedback loops are good in gentle environments. An example of a gentle environment is software development. Outcomes are clearly specified, frameworks are common and work well, and your actions receive instant and accurate feedback.

- feedback loops which are too short for the overall system makes people focus on inappropriate intermediate goals. It’s the main cause of catastrophic long term strategic mistakes.

- As we become proficient, the environment becomes harsher, with noisier feedback. Improving is not as easy. At higher levels of skill, further progression depends on self-learning, on discovering or inventing new practices and knowledge. As skill increases, the gap between optimizing for metrics and optimizing for mastery widens.

- The more accurate and more rapid the loop, the more quickly you’ll arrive at the top of the hill – and the less chance you have of leaving it to climb the mountains of mastery.

- The alternative: how easy is it to learn from noisy data?
    - Tags: [[systems]] [[learning]] [[data]] 
- Learning under conditions of noisy data starts with world construction. Imagine a possible future, and repeat this to generate hundreds of possible future worlds. The main skills and resources required are creativity, slack, and equanimity.

- Next, we eliminate some incorrect worlds by testing them against noisy data. This data should come from intermediate steps and can’t be quantified.
    - Tags: [[systems]] [[learning]] [[data]] 
- As we near decision time, we stop the world construction and elimination, and use judgment and experience to pick the best idea out of the remaining ones. Process improvement happens by creating many parallel processes and discarding the ones that are unfit, not by iteratively improving a single process.

- Creativity is a function of being well-read and having exposed to a variety of stimuli.
