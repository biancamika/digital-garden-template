## Highlights
- Why does the increasing capacity of machines necessarily mean the end of the Enlightenment?
- the Enlightenment was not simply an intellectual movement promoting reason and rationality, but also a fundamentally political movement.
- Japan exposed the dilemma of technological globalization: on one hand, the spread of technology constructs a global axis of time though which European modernity becomes the synchronizing metric of all civilizations; on the other, the same spread frees modern science and technology from being the exclusive asset of European modernity, rendering the West vulnerable to global competition.
