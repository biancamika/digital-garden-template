## Highlights
- I refer to this as the problem of graph design: When designing an app that shapes its user experience off of a social graph, how do you ensure the user ends up with the optimal graph to get the most value out of your product/service?
    - Tags: [[social]] 
- The problem with approximating an interest graph with a social graph is that social graphs have negative network effects that kick in at scale.
- noted that social networks tend to compete on three axes: social capital, entertainment, and utility.
- To put it even stronger, graph design problems are particularly dangerous to social companies because they fall into that class of mistakes that are difficult to reverse.
- If people tend to add to their social graphs more than they prune them, the social graph you help your users design should be treated as a one-way decision.
- Not only do users not notice it happening, like the proverbial slow boiling frog, the people operating the apps may be oblivious to the phase shifts until it's
- But this ignores all the ways in which apps put their hands on the scale to nudge each user towards a specific type of graph.
- the network itself provides the lion's share of the value for a social network, that arguments about what types of content to allow in feeds, how those were formatted, were of much less importance.
- Another way apps really influence the shape of their social graph is with suggested follow lists.
- Instead of fixing the root problem of the graph design, however, most apps opt instead to patch the problem. The most popular method is to switch to an algorithmic, rather than chronological, feed.
