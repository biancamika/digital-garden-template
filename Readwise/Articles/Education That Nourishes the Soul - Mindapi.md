## Highlights
- “Things that remain in our hearts, even as time passes, is something that is really important to us,”
- Learning with a clear application goal in mind is like cooking rice in an electric rice cooker. It’s efficient and predictable, exactly what I need under a tight deadline. Learning for leisure or out of curiosity, with no idea of when I’ll get to apply what I learn, is like cooking rice in a stone pot. It’s slow and I risk burning the rice, but the mild smokiness makes the rice more memorable than any other ones from the electric cooker because it nourishes the soul.
