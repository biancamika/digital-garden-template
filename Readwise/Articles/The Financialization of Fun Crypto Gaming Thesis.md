## Highlights
- “Play-first” crypto games where the fun gameplay takes centre stage and crypto is used as a competitive edge to engage players further.
- “Earn-first” crypto games where the main allure, gameplay and fun ultimately come from earning money by participating in crypto game economies.
- games allow people to fulfill their basic desires in ways that bring them more gratification with lower hurdles than fulfilling them in real life (see: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs). Said another way, humans enjoy playing the same life games in parameterized and alternate realities. The most popular games capitalize on mimetic desire and simultaneously shape desires while creating the in-game loop to satisfy them.
- While this sounds like a gaming cardinal sin, in many ways, crypto investing and trading could be thought of as the internet’s largest Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) and, for many, it’s deeply addictive and fun.
- I believe that the games that end up succeeding over the next decade are the ones that use crypto to unlock fresh gameplay mechanics instead of simply forcing P2E mechanics into the same traditional games we see today.
- Currently, the best games simulate and parameterize the same life games we play but with guardrails or in closed economies.
- Financializing parts of the games through tokens or NFTs removes a major guardrail that fundamentally changes the gameplay and opens games to inherit the full financial landscape of the “real” world.
- it’s easy to forget that the main reason games tokenize assets is because it introduces monetary value or makes the asset more composable.
- While most crypto games currently use NFTs as a store of value, NFTs can also be designed for other creative purposes like building identities across different games or sharing them with your friends.
- Tokenizing in-game assets introduces a difficult design problem because adding monetary value to game assets risks negatively affecting gameplay.
- Game psychologists note that a lot of the joy and addiction comes from unexpected and randomized rewards.
