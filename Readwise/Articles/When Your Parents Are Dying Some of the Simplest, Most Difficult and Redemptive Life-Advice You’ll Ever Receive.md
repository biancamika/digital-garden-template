## Highlights
- “Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself,”
- And yet we are, each of us, someone’s child — physiologically or psychologically or both — and they sing themselves through us as we sing ourselves into our longing for life, whether we like the melody or not.
- They are part of you in a way that runs beneath the daily self. They have passed an essence to you.

- Being with a dying parent, Gaitskill notes, is a way of honoring the fact — so basic yet so incomprehensible a fact — that they will soon be gone, and with them will go your experience of being their child in the way you have known, a fundamental way in which you have known yourself. At the heart of this dual recognition is “the hard truth that we know nothing about who we are or what our lives mean.”
- That’s why I advised that you satay “for as long as you can.”
- But they were with you. When they are dying, remember that. And go be with them.
