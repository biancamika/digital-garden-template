## Highlights
- Philosophical counseling is a once-niche but now burgeoning practice in which people with academic philosophy training set out to be like modern-day Socrates in the marketplace, helping their clients examine beliefs, values, and assumptions as they attempt to lead a better life.
- Lindley described philosophical counselors as “personal trainers for the mind and soul.”
- Philosophy is in the background of your beliefs about what love and friendship are, what makes up a meaningful life, and what family is, along with issues of justice and ethics. Philosophical counseling seeks to help with a process already taking place within you.
- What is a philosophical problem of living, and what is an emotional problem better dealt with by psychology? Is philosophical counseling a replacement for therapy? An add-on? Is a philosophical counselor just a life coach with a Ph.D.?
- The turn to philosophy represents a desire for a different way of interrogating our mental lives and making meaning, in the pursuit of the highest goal (according to Plato): a good and virtuous life.
- In the 1990s, Pierre Grimes founded the “philosophical midwifery movement," based on Socratic midwifery, as described in Plato’s dialogue The Theaetetus. The idea is that every person has their own philosophy inside of them, and a philosopher's job is to help an individual birth their own truth.
- Raabe described to me his conviction that there’s a marked difference between the mind and the brain, and that philosophers “can’t fix brains, but we can help people to adjust their minds.” But this is a philosophical stance unto itself, and many scientists or philosophers who argue for embodied cognition would not agree that there is such a clear difference or duality between the material stuff of the body and the consciousness that emerges from it.
