## Highlights
- In his view, athletes are the archetype of self-improvement, and anyone who wanted to be a better person, to cultivate this most important skill, could learn from their example.
- In other words, sport is fundamentally about what you do when the chips are down, not what you say or plan beforehand.
- When we do not act upon what we think is right, we are acting like an athlete who trains but never competes. What is the point?
- This kind of discussion naturally leads to the difficult question of what the ‘right’ thing to do is.
- But we can strive to be better only if we are also resilient, because improving ourselves is hard.
- Athletes since Epictetus’ time have developed a trick we can borrow: they turn hardship into opportunity by looking for the lessons within a failure.
- When you lose your temper with someone who is rude, or unkind, do not think of them as an enemy. Think of them as a training partner in the character gym. They will push you, test your limits, and show you where you need to improve.
- If we can approach such situations as athletes would, we can learn to be grateful for difficulties and opportunities to fail.
- If the Stoics and Epictetus are right, and being an excellent person is analogous to a skill or craft, then we should approach self-improvement and philosophy as athletes approach their sport: with an emphasis on action, and with the resiliency to keep learning and practising despite failure and struggle.
