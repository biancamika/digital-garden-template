## Highlights
- the most significant aspect of DAOs is that they allow us to re-imagine incentive structures within organizations.
- Status signaling is inherent to human nature, and as is our correlation between exclusivity and desirability.
- If everything you do to contribute to the DAO’s community (running interest-based clubs, conducting peer learning workshops, etc.) is recorded on-chain, it’s very easy for your peers (or anyone) to verify that you did those things.
- As long as a member holds the tokens, they will be invested in the DAO and contribute in the hopes of increasing the token’s value and receiving individual rewards. This token-based model introduces a financial incentive that strengthens personal incentives to contribute to the community.
- The very essence of a DAO goes against the traditional ideas of “work” and “success” that many of us grow up with,
- DAOs solve the broken college → industry system we’re seeing in the status quo today, which stems from huge incentive misalignment.
- Fundamentally, in order to manage the volume of students that come through various programs, universities implement standardized policies that strongly restrict students’ ability to shape their own academic journeys.
- With DAOs, it is very probable that you will actually learn more skills and knowledge relevant to doing what you’re interested in because you’d hopefully have more creative freedom in the learning process.
- DAOs are an opportunity for us to re-think how to balance operating at scale and providing high-quality learning experiences.
- The most promising aspect of admissions in a web3 world is that the college application process for students could be so much more streamlined thanks to the blockchain. Because the work students did leading up to college could be verified and made public for anyone to see, the amount of time, money, and effort students pour into college applications now would drastically decrease in web3. The only aspect of today’s college application process that would still need to occur is an evaluation of community compatibility (the closest web2 equivalent of which is an interview with an alumnus).
- To that, I say, gaining a holistic view of who a person is, what their interests and hobbies are, and what their goals are for attending university would be much easier and truer to the word “holistic” in a web3 world (where more of our lives are online) than just reading a couple of essays they wrote about who they are.

- In web3, however, token ownership doesn’t necessarily terminate after your education is formally marked as “complete” (if that would even be a thing in web3). A lifelong token holder and contributor could be a lifelong member of that DAO.
- DAOs have the potential to unlock tangible lifelong value for token holders, not just financially.
