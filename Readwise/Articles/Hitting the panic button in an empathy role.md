## Highlights
- With the rise of the empathy worker, we must also normalize the rise of caring for our colleagues, friends, and collaborators. Otherwise, we let the systems that have us reaching for connection, empathy, and kindness in the first place win.
- “If you’re trying to carry on while people around you die, your society is not collapsing. It’s already fallen down.”
- My real beef with empathy as it is used today is the same as with any other pop psychology buzzword: demanding empathy is a way broken systems shunt responsibility for their failures onto individuals. In this narrative, chaos or violence happens because people lack empathy – a trainable 'skill' that's in everyone's reach, cue World Economic Forum – not because those in power screwed us over with bad policies and terrible governance that bred inequality and injustice.
