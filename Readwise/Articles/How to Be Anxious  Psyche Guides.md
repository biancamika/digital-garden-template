## Highlights
- anxiety is the consequence of an honest confrontation with freedom. Nothing but our own free choice determines what we will make of ourselves, and the consequences of that choice echo through eternity. For the most part, we don’t feel the burden of this responsibility because we simply go along with the crowd. Anxiety (ångest in Danish) lifts us out of that happy torpor and confronts us with our individual responsibility. This anxiety is burdensome and terrifying but also liberating.

- In that gap between motive and action – a gap that doesn’t exist between cause and effect – lies the experience of freedom. And we experience that freedom, Sartre says, as anxiety or anguish (angoisse).

- Vertigo, by contrast, is a response not to my subjection to external forces but to my freedom.

- Anxiety is the chilling recognition of that freedom.

- Vertigo is anxiety oriented toward the future: it’s a recognition of the radical freedom of my future self with regard to my present self. Sartre also imagines a past-oriented anxiety in the form of a gambling addict.

- What we don’t realise for the most part, according to Heidegger, is that the world isn’t a collection of self-standing items but an interconnected whole bound together by care.

- For Sartre, anxiety reveals something about us. For Heidegger, it reveals something about the world – or rather the way that we’re related to it.

- In anxiety, it’s not just the words we use that lose their familiar meaning but the things in the world around us.

- I don’t simply find myself in a world that makes sense; the significance of the world is connected to the significance I find in my everyday activities. And that means that I am partway responsible for the sense the world makes to me.

- Anxiety is discomfiting because it presents us with the stark reminder that it doesn’t have to be this way while providing no guidance about what way it might be instead.

- If anxiety for Sartre is the recognition that neither our own resolve nor social scripts can constrain our actions, embracing that freedom needn’t be chilling. It could be awesome.

- At its most productive, anxiety can shake us out of comfortable habits and help us see possibilities – for ourselves and for the world – that ordinarily escape our notice.

- Existential anxiety is a kind of perception.
