## Highlights
- Tumblr teens have an advantage that makes them good at digital strategy: an advanced emotional intelligence.
- Everyone will steal their jokes. A
- “Relatable” has a slightly different meaning on the teen internet than in the adult world, and even its purveyors struggle to describe it. Lilley called it “a thought, feeling or idea that resonates with others.” Based on my years of immersion, I’d say it’s more about revealing vulnerabilities.
- So teens have schemes to evade the bots.
- Having spent several years among teens who have freely laid bare their inside jokes, their Facebook messages, and their deepest thoughts, I think there are three phases of understanding the teens. At first you loathe the teens, because you know nothing about them and think they’re idiots, beneath you. Then you love the teens because you figure out they are smarter than you, and you make peace with the death of your cultural relevance, because you know you’ll be in good hands. Finally, you recognize the shape of the adults they’ll become, corrupted by money and vanity and hubris just like everyone else. And you’ll see yourself in them because they’re relatable: That moment you realize the teens are just like you.
