## Highlights
- But unlike web2 profiles, decentralized identities are backed by hard evidence: a permanent, timestamped record of a person’s accomplishments, contributions, interests, and activities to date.
- If decentralized identity were widely adopted, people would be able to carry their full selves with them as they traverse cyberspace: their affinities and experiences reflected by what they’ve created, contributed to, earned, and owned online, no matter the specific platform.
- a real opportunity here is in leveraging on-chain reputation for off-chain uses. In the creator economy, for instance,
- In contrast to most web2 profiles, decentralized identity is not ephemeral.
- This persistence establishes new incentives for reputation-building: instead of creating temporary profiles like we do in web2, web3 promotes long-term thinking.

- If people were empowered to build and maintain permanent identities online, we believe that on-chain systems could encourage people to more carefully curate the reputation markers that they carry with them into the future.

- But in order to mainstream decentralized identity, we must first establish systems that map people’s relevant off-chain experiences and affiliations on-chain. Then we must build mechanisms to standardize, process, and prioritize the influx of data that will be added on-chain. On the way, we’ll need to solve endemic challenges to decentralized identity, including the lack of context around on-chain records and issues around gaining access to the decentralized web.

- To make decentralized identity useful and widespread, it is important to introduce on-ramps for people to record their experiences and affinities on the blockchain, such as their educational accomplishments, professional achievements, or fanships.
- When people claim these tokens, they’re purposely recording a “life event” on-chain, making it a part of their digital identity in the process. Similarly, people might make active attestations of other people’s skills, character traits, or accomplishments by sending them tokens; these testaments can be verified through peer review or an assessment of activities on-chain.
- For the sake of logistical simplicity (and because different facets of a person’s identity naturally overlap and interact), it makes sense to store one’s relevant activities and contributions in a single wallet. But any given person isn’t solely a creator, builder, investor, or collector; they’re many things at once. Thus, we need some way to take parts of their decentralized identity and showcase them in different digital spaces to distinct audiences. Imagine a design in which the wallet’s overall content was kept private, but accessing a specific facet of a person’s reputation required a specific access key.
- Managing reputation information also requires publicly accessible data standards — agreed upon formats for, say, “what an attestation of a contribution looks like” or “how to formulate an on-chain record.” Structuring these inputs to reputation ensures interoperability, both (1) enabling people to meaningfully combine parts of their decentralized identity from different services and (2) minimizing friction for platforms to interact with different facets of a person’s on-chain reputation.
- The existing technology that records inputs tends to be very primitive — mostly limited to transaction histories — but something as subjective and complicated as identity will require considerably more context. Contextualizing information explains why you’ve earned or bought an artefact.
- A system built around permanence also presents challenges around escaping past versions of one’s identity, as is evident in credit scores and other long-run reputation mechanisms today. It can mean that you never escape a mistake.
- In addition, crypto wallets offer little protection against data being lost or compromised. Before crypto can serve as a mainstream repository for identity and reputation, it will need to provide the sorts of security protections we are used to from other services.
- By moving identities on-chain, we could upend archaic financial processes and provide equitable access to capital, re-architect how talent is matched with projects, and provide entirely new paradigms for recognizing and compensating labor online.
- The portability and accessibility of decentralized identities, on the other hand, could allow us to significantly disrupt how our reputations are used within our current financial systems. For example, on-chain reputations could enable an internet-native credit score that would unlock a variety of financial use cases, including issuing loans, performing tenant checks, or establishing credit.
- Here especially, however, there needs to be strong consideration of how users might be able to add context and curate their permanent public histories to avoid undue prejudice. It would be important to circumvent the digital equivalent of getting evicted, hindering your ability to obtain future housing.
- In the realm of talent sourcing, decentralized identities promise “open CVs” based on fine-grained records of professional activities and accomplishments. This could allow for a fuller picture of someone’s past work and provide more granular insight into their skills and contributions.
- With decentralized identities that track contributions across the internet, we will be better able to gauge how early someone was to a topic or trend and how much value someone is contributing to a subject matter.
- If we had a better understanding of people’s willingness to pay for distinct pieces of content, we would have a better perspective on magnitude of engagement or interest.
- Furthermore, if every piece of content on the internet were truly composable or remixable, it could be possible to gauge which content inspires further creation, or is the most meme-able.
- Finally, and perhaps the most disruptive of all, people could become the new platforms for discovery — especially is incentivized through token models.

- If we progress toward an internet in which our identities are tied to us instead of being scattered across siloed spaces on the web, we’ll get closer to how things work in the physical world: our online possessions will belong to us and we’ll be able to take our full, authentic selves across cyberspace.
