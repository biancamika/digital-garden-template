## Highlights
- This speculative piece considers what it might be like if the internet was a living entity
- Even in common discourse, we borrow words like “ecosystems”, “growth”, and “evolution” in reference to its complexity and dynamism.
- The internet is oxygen to our society.
- put it simply, can envisioning what a healthy living internet looks like enable us to reconsider the social, technological, and environmental conditions that help it – and us – flourish?
- Imagining the internet as a long-lasting natural system is also an opportunity to overcome our bias for short-term thinking.
