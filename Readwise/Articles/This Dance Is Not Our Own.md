## Highlights
- “Real recognises real”, or in other words, only those that know themselves to be “authentic” and “genuine” are able to recognise others that hold the same “realness”.
- I think the reason why we are able to recognise those that are “real” and authentic, doesn’t stem purely from moves or an external showcasing of one’s “realness”. It’s because we see a vulnerability, the path that someone took to get to that state of authenticity. They have gone further, they’ve adapted the moves that were passed down and resisted the need to prove themselves extrinsically.
- I’d argue that in order to maintain a sense of an authentic identity in the long-term (in other words, to “keep it real”), one needs to go through a continual cycle of doubt and affirmation, over and over again. To be able to question ourselves, our individual truths and to doubt, change and grow.
