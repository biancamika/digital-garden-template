## Highlights
- Its fundamental evolutionary trait: to design our interactions with the world, with care and mutual respect — together.
- Life creates conditions conducive to life. Our attention, our thinking and our coming together: this is a garden which can be grown. With care, with growing awareness of social permaculture, this garden may be cultivated: to liberate ever more members and companions of humankind into a deep-world society based on living systems. Everything gardens. Every dream, every discussion, every task, every lesson… and every choice we make, grows.
- A permaculturist designs from the awareness that ecology and society are interconnected;
- Those who take a special interest in the social and societal aspects of permaculture (my colleagues and I included) specialize, evidently, in “social permaculture”. The systems we design with can include education, economies, policies and decision-making, ownership, healthcare, childcare, elder care, project design, operations, preventing activist burnout, and so on.
- pro-social design must also integrate environmental conditions.
- entering the world of “tech” from a permaculture state of heart-mind exposes us to questions and possibilities of exponential proportions.
- developments in Web3/dWeb technologies can inspire many insights about how emerging technologies could improve our economic and governance systems.
- Underneath all this understandable resistance is the steep learning curve which some feel permanently excluded from.
- By thinking like a village, members of the permaculture community across the world are starting to self-organize to share the load, and the adventure.
- Local economies have been integrated into the theory & praxis of permaculture for most of its life.
- knowledge about creating regenerative systems.
