## Highlights
- Technology preserves these moments, gift and curse of eternity laid in human hands.
    - Tags: [[tech]] 
- The average life expectancy of a webpage is a hundred days. This average is likely to be far lower for materials that live on social media.
    - Tags: [[tech]] 
- This is where the “build fast and break things” mentality thrives, right next to the the “execution is everything” mantra.

    - Note: Use for essay?
- Humanity’s own limited cognitive capacity has naturally built up constraint and limitation against a once-seemingly infinite world where distance and proximity meant nearly nothing.

- Our data alone is invaluable, far too cheap for how easy we give it away now. Our memories become priceless, and the internet’s promise is the closest thing we have.

- The attention economy handpicks what survives, and no one remembers how loss comes so easy.

- The things that matter most to us are likely not what’s preserved by another. Self-preservation in the age of internet decay must then become priority.

- We do know however that the screen recording is for now, a window of sincerity and truth in an easily editable internet.

- The issue with digital journalism and the prospect of civic engagement comes to this: the nature of mass-scale reporting, or any type of reporting that deals with facts, is impossible to navigate with the way humans communicate and deal information.

- In Are We Human?, Beatriz Colomina articulates this perfectly: we face both the magnificence of technology as the most human thing as we are the only species that creates tools to make tools––reinventing ourselves with artifacts, and also the wrath and dangers of technology in its wiping of us, and perhaps, in its existence and our misjudgment. Tools will remain as tools.

- The movement towards curation over present-day’s influencer domination reflects a necessary need to both free us from information overload to the historical model of putting the work of the digest into the hands of select curators, and the larger community at once.

- We’re navigating a lull of the web where environments are both ephemeral until they aren’t, where we have no control of the ever-changing conditions of the cyberspace. This is the internet of the dead, of false memories, and gaslighting. I live my youth in pixels and lose it as quickly as it happened.

- Because humanity has never been able to communicate and exchange thought at such a rapid pace, we may need a radical rethinking of the standards and practices we employ when referencing ideals to better use tools to their maximum potential: to archive, restore, remark, and preserve––respecting both provenance and posterity––using full use of the tools we have developed, with intentional awareness of what these materials could mean.
    - Tags: [[humanist]] [[design]] [[communication]] 
- We need new modes of citation and cross-referencing that don’t take away from these natural flows of conversation (e.g. Twitter’s decision to be gentler with links and @s when navigating text limits).
    - Tags: [[tech]] [[social]] [[communication]] 
- Webpages should be treated like nodes, letting conversations and interactions flow between different spaces in the internet.
    - Tags: [[web]] [[tech]] 
- To reject hyperlinks is to reject coherent thought, discovery, and exploration.
    - Tags: [[web]] [[tech]] 
- Content will thrive on the internet when material can be cross-linked and referenced easily either on web or mobile.
    - Tags: [[web]] [[tech]] [[content]] 
- Metadata about materials needs human support to be meaningful; materials do not exist in silos and in isolation. If we design interfaces and systems that encourage more mindful, manual input and interaction with metadata, we can inspire better behavior from the humans that nurture and grow these packets of information.

- If we care about the life we live on the internet, humanity must take steps to take care of its words.
    - Tags: [[humanist]] 
- We need content standards for linking towards and referencing content.
    - Tags: [[web]] [[content]] 
- Recognize the gift of context in our interactions.
    - Tags: [[social]] 
- Thinking of someone when encountering something means sharing a snippet, and receiving a world of wealth back.
    - Tags: [[humanist]] 
- The most radical attempts to reshape the human are typically carried out under this guise of reinforcing and protecting the human. Design is a paradoxical gesture that changes the human in order to protect it.
