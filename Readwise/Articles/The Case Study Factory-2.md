- Because these bootcamps are by definition short programs, they tend to focus exclusively on the practical skills and methods that a UX designer needs to find their first job. This means that such courses tend to skip what might be considered the foundational disciplines of digital design, such as anthropology, philosophy, art history, and graphic design.
