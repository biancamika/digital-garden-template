## Highlights
- Social capital is internet reputation.
- Reputation is justified based on what you do online and in real life * Social capital is achieved based on how well you use the internet
- At the core of decentralization is a push toward individual freedom. Not freedom to, but freedom from.
- The centralized infrastructure of the internet is problem #1.
- The lack of interoperability between web platforms is problem #2.
- It changes the incentives to create by letting users earn royalties rather than money. Not only can users earn equity, but they can logically prove social capital through their content:
- Judgment, skills, and participation are all demonstrated through your crypto wallets. Itâ€™s like a dynamic resume that upgrades based on how well you use the internet.
- Crypto-wallets are a passport to web 3 applications.
- Social capital on-chain would be justified, not assumed.
- NFTs offer a way to prove who owns online content.
- NFTs are traced by merkle trees to move between platforms based on their token address. Content can be transferrable unlike web 2 applications like LinkedIn.
- People can display proof of reputation based on how well they use the internet
- Skills can logically be measured through crypto wallets, public, and private keys tracked on-chain
- Creative work will progress as verification and authentication are automated
