## Highlights
- The emergence of south east Asianeconomies has dramatically increased the demand for higher education. The dramatic expan-sion and demand for higher education has raised concerns about the quality of programmingand prompted calls for regulation of this sector.
- While higher edu-cation has often provided opportunities to build local capacity and reduce levels of poverty,depending upon the levels of support provided by government and the aims of institutions,the global classroom may offer empowerment or a reenactment of a tragic colonial legacy.In sum, with knowledge comes responsibility as well as power, given the direction from in-ternational bodies, the choices that we make as educators and institutions will reveal the truenature of our project.
