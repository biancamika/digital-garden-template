## Highlights
- we must move beyond the Silicon Valley tendency to instrumentalize, or to treat something as a means or resource for achieving some end goal.

- Many tech workers approach their own lives with a similar growth-oriented mindset. Even most types of “fun” are telic, or made instrumental in pursuit of some kind of goal. Books must be read with a note-taking system; exercise must be quantified and tracked; friendships are managed in personal CRMs; casual hangouts and dating apps are covert recruitment missions. This optimistic instrumentalization attitude is incredibly useful. Technologists decide on goals, then effectively use resources to achieve those goals.

- German philosopher Martin Heidegger argued that this instrumentalization is a natural consequence of organizing life under technology. He claimed that under a technological worldview, the world, including oneself, ceases to have presence or value in its own right, and is regarded instead as a ‘standing-reserve’, that is, merely a resource to be extracted from. 
  For ease, let’s call this the instrumentalizing worldview, although there are many different components to it that are all interdependent: the desire to optimize for easily quantifiable metrics, which are usually in some form a path or proxy to profit, the tendency to regard everything as a resource, and a utilitarian philosophy where values are comparable and aggregatable.

- This worldview is additionally limited by acute technosocial opacity,1 where the effects of any given technology are hard to foresee or calculate.

- This worldview is “the water”; it’s embedded in the very metaphors that technologists use to describe themselves, their relationships to others, and the world.

- do not work on something if you yourself do not want to live in the world where you are massively successful.

- Resist being context-collapsed to a one-dimensional being.

- Technologists intervene in our present realities and forge the future, and in doing so, choose how best to model the world and impress their will upon it. The public must insist that technologists are responsible for thinking about the human implications of their work.

- Technologists must have (literal) space for thought.
