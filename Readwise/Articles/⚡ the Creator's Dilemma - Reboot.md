## Highlights
- When we discuss the creator economy we need to consider questions beyond compensation — who gets access to content, how content is produced, what type of content is incentivized — in order to take full advantage of the abundance digital media promises us.

- One interesting alternative is a platform-funded Universal Creator Income (UCI), as spelled out by Li Jin and Lila Shroff. Unlike programs like Substack Pro or TikTok Creator Fund, a UCI could provide funding regardless of skill or background, focusing on emerging creators who might not have had an ability to create full time.

- The P2P Foundation cites David Bollier’s definition of a commons as “a shared resource which is co-governed by its user community, according to the rules and norms of that community.”

- NFTs are tokens that represent ownership of a specific asset, such as a song or art piece, without necessarily restricting access to it.

- NFT sales are likely to mimic power law dynamics and favor already established artists.4 In addition, NFTs still relegate creation to market forces, promoting the production of sensational, provocative content. The model is unlikely to support ‘boring’ creation like news reporting and creative maintenance — information that is necessary but seen as less ‘artistic,’ and thus less likely to fetch large sums on an exchange.

- The commons, however, also refers to an alternate production process and a series of social processes and relationships that facilitate a commons “ecosystem.” The commons-based peer production (CBPP) process revolves around three institutions: a productive community, a commons-oriented market entity, and a for-benefit organization.
