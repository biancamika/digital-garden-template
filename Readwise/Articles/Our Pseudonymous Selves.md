## Highlights
- A connection between your online and real world identities has utility: attention accrued, opportunities extended, and money made. But the reverse is true too. A connection between your online and real world identities has consequences: open ostracization, jobs jeopardized, and status ceded. It’s hard to imagine this doesn’t have chilling effects on speech, creativity, and the exploration of identity.
- In many ways, “bring your whole self to work” is a double entendre, a slogan for companies to capture more and more of an employee’s life, often through long hours and off-hours work for low pay. The pandemic, the rise of remote work, and the Great Resignation have generated more pushback than ever against the idea that employers are owed anything more than is contractually stipulated. Much has been said about our inability to separate ourselves from our jobs; pseudonymity could provide a means of redefining our relationship to work.
- He suggests that technology has evolved to support widespread pseudonymity allowing for multiple pseudonyms for one person, for instance “an earning name, writing name, and a legal name” that allows people to essentially diversify their identity portfolio, avoiding complete reputational harm in the event of a coordinated social attack. While this might seem daunting and unfamiliar, many of us already move between multiple “identities” in the real world—parent, spouse, child, friend, employee; in this light, a diversified presentation of self online is natural.
- Ideas power the world, yet there are particular identities and archetypes within our society whose ideas confer more attention, authority, and respect. If you’re illegible, it’s harder to be grouped and discriminated against; people from periphery groups can participate in online spaces that might normally be less welcoming. Better ideas might rise to the top if we valued the ideas of people who are younger. The world might be improved if we didn’t ignore the opinions of people without post-secondary education by default. Much might be illuminated by seriously considering viewpoints from those residing in developing countries.
- Real names might come to be just one in a collection of assumed identities. In some ways, the internet is giving us the tools to formalize what we all already knew: we contain multitudes. Pseudonymity provides an opportunity to express ourselves differently, exploring online spaces and ideas without the weight of maintaining a singular consistent way of being. Pseudonymity may also provide the chance to reshape our lives, separating personal and professional and finding different meanings in these newly separate parts of our lives. It’s possible that by becoming unknown, we become more ourselves.
