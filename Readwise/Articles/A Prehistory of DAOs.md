## Highlights
- “The internet consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself”
- DAO comes from imagining how features of decentralized technology, such as global digital assets, censorship resistance, and automated actions, will change how organizations operate.
- a DAO could be described then as a capitalized organization in which a software protocol informs its operation, placing automation at its center and humans at its edges.
- a DAO could be described as a voluntary association with the operating principles of digital cooperativism. As voluntary associations, they are a cross-jurisdictional way for strangers, friends, or unlikely allies to pseudonymously come together toward common goals, supported by a token model, incentives, and governance. Members of a DAO can have representative ownership of its digital assets through a token, which often simultaneously acts as a governance right.
