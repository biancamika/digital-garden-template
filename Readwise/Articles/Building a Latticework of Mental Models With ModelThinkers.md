## Highlights
- We are seeing both the pressure and opportunity of people being expected to move up the “cognitive food chain”, away from routine work that can be easily automated, and demonstrate greater value with increased critical thinking, adaptability, innovation and collaboration.

- We view mental models as simplified representations, concepts, and frameworks that everyone uses to understand and act in the world.

- The invisible models. These are the heuristics and cognitive biases that rule our decisions when our more conscious brain isn’t paying attention — which is almost all the time. They include classics like Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Sunk Cost Fallacy and so many more.

- The basic models. These are the mental models we take for granted as we navigate through the routine of our existence. For example, the mental representations we rely on when making a sandwich or finding our way to work.

- The contextual ones. These might be developed through specialist study or cycles of personal experience and reflection. They help us to act in our specific environment and/or domain and might include how a radiologist interprets medical imaging; or a personal lesson that might have limited transferability, like how to work with your current boss who tends to be moody on Tuesdays, but open to ideas that reference statistics, etc.

- The big ideas. These are the mental models that are powerful, repeatedly useful for many people, and highly applicable across varying contexts and domains. They include Second Order Thinking, Return on Failure, the Hero’s Journey, and many more.

- I mentioned that everyone uses mental models, but most do it unconsciously. In contrast, Munger advocates consciously building a latticework of useful mental models so that you can see any problem through a variety of lenses and perspectives. It’s the difference between solving every problem with a single hammer, as opposed to having a dynamic cognitive toolkit at your disposal.

- At a basic level, it’s a self awareness and communication process of starting with the facts or an observation; then considering what feelings are invoked by that observation; then digging below the feelings to the (un)met need; before formulating a request that can address that need.

- Compounding in this context is all about consistently building on marginal gains — it’s the familiar idea of going to bed a little bit smarter than when you woke up, every day.

- So pace yourself, explore a model a week. Take your time, mull each one over as you think about how it connects with or challenges the models you currently use. Importantly, don’t leave it as a thought exorcise — take action and experiment with it by applying it in different ways, in different contexts. If you can, identify someone who uses the model well and observe them in action.

- Second, create playbooks for the moments that matter. My second big tip is to break down Munger’s Latticework concept into personal playbooks for the ‘moments that matter’ in your world. This is about understanding Fast Thinking & Slow Thinking and that our brains are on automatic pilot for most of each day, for most of our lives.
