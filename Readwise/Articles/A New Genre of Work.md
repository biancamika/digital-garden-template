## Highlights
- It’s clear that the most thorny problems facing humanity today—climate crisis, cybersecurity, income inequality to name a few—will not be solved by one corporation or one individual. These problems need to be addressed with the scale and efficiency of a corporation, without compromising on individual autonomy, creativity, and ownership. They require fluid and multidisciplinary collaboration that transcends the borders of institutions, from corporations to nation-states.
- In the absence of a management team or an HR department to delineate the paths of a contributor, how can we incentivize everyone in a network of communities to discover where they can contribute the most value? How can we empower each other to work flexibly and autonomously, while still fostering a sense of security, belonging, and identity?
- Contributors must be able to port their body of work across organizations. In the current labor system, workers are made legible by the institutions they belong to. A worker's entire identity—their work, reputation, relationships—exists in the blackbox of an insular permission-controlled database. Once a worker leaves the organization, their identity is effectively erased and they must rebuild and retell their narrative within the context of another institution. Web3 allows contributors to have ownership over their body of work while their entire system of record exists on-chain, providing the context needed for contributors’ reputation to become legible to multiple communities.
- Contributions and credibility must be interoperable and fluid. To
- Infrastructure that is designed around interoperability will allow stronger inter-network cooperability and fluidity to emerge.
- Power and authority in the contributor economy must be emergent, not assigned.
