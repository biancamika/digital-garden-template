## Highlights
- The highest percentages of the creative class -- in the range of 40 to 45 percent -- are found in wealthy, advanced nations like the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Scandinavia, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.

- another closely related measure that is more systematically available for a larger group of nations -- the level of human capital -- the percentage of the young adults engaged in post-secondary or "tertiary" education. This measure is closely related to creative class workforce (with a substantial statistical correlation of .75).

- Nations with substantial creative class shares and levels of high human capital tend to be among the richest in the world.

- We created simple ratios, dividing the creative class percentage of the workforce on the one hand, and human capital levels on the other, by the level of economic output (GDP) per capita.
  Revolution = size of creative class, the unrealized potential of creative class (ratio of creative class to GDP), creative class consciousness and organization (internet and social media access).
