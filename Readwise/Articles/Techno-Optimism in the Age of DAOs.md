## Highlights
- But the way our tools shape us, embed themselves in us, and form core parts of our experience as we navigate the world is almost always fast-paced, unpredictable, and largely distinct from anything prior.
- While it’s helpful for us to consider how we set new norms that allow us to still distance ourselves from the things arguably creating societal distance, to step out of the metaverse, many of those who want to see change are making a grave mistake by refusing to use technology’s speed and scale to empower people.
- If progressive movements want to remain relevant, they must embrace techno-optimism, and the idea of building parallel systems that simply offer better alternatives to the ideas and behaviors people naturally gravitate to.
- For better or worse, we live in a world of institutions and tools, and we must shape the tools we want to use. “What utopian demands might we dream of for technology’s future? Who is working on bringing them about?”
