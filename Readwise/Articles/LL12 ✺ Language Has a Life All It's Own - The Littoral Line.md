## Highlights
- Communication between human beings is difficult. Unlike every other animal on Earth, we use language to transmit more than behaviour cues: we transmit meaning. We feel like it’s an automatic part of the natural universe, but it is not. And this hides that fact that all objective truths are each arrived at subjectively.

- The point is that problem definitions and their solutions require clear and specific language—what David Deutsch calls hard-to-vary explanations—in the hope of fostering shared understanding. Yet the process of creative thought—the iceberg in-between understanding the problem definition and proposing solutions—needs rich, unrestricted thinking, a process that begins by doing away with the rigours of explanatory language and instead playing with possibilities, which includes swimming with the words themselves.
