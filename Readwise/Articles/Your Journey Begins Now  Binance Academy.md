## Highlights
- In cryptocurrencies, there isn't an organization. You, your friends, and thousands of others can act as your own banks by running free software. Your computer connects with other people's computers, meaning you communicate directly â€“ no middlemen required!

- A blockchain is just a database.
    - Tags: [[blockchain]] 
- blockchains are append-only. That means that you can only add information - you can't just click on a cell and delete stuff that you've already added, or change it in any way.
    - Tags: [[blockchain]] 
- each entry (called a block) in the database is cryptographically linked to the last entry. In plain English, each new entry must contain a sort of digital fingerprint (hash) of the last one.
    - Tags: [[blockchain]] 
- A blockchain is immutable: if you change a block, it changes the fingerprint.
    - Tags: [[blockchain]] 
- It's that everyone can download blocks from other people on the network to build identical copies of the blockchain on their computers.

- Because of some cryptography, game theory, and something called a consensus algorithm, the system prevents you from spending funds you shouldn't be able to spend.

- staking means getting rewards for locking up coins. So, if you invest in a coin that supports staking, you could build up a larger holding over time.
