## Highlights
- that which is unique, breaks.
- If we are richer today, why are we not routinely surpassing the shared spaces we were able to create one hundred years ago?
- Do we engage in the act of imagining public spaces at all?
- These are improvements, but the urge to commoditize alone improves a seen monetary cost at the expense of the unseen. We must not think it comes free of charge.
- But when the unique breaks, we might mend.

- To learn the skill of mending is to also gain unconsciously the skill of building, to understand the very urge to build. If we never mend, we not only risk building less but building in perverse ways.
- When the unique is created, it also creates the creator.
- The more things become commodities, the more we start to treat places and people like commodities, too.
- The divine is still within people, and will not leave.
- But what will it take to value the ecology that fosters the unique, the creations that made some places and things so special that we call them works of art, or travel across the world just to see them?
- If we want the forest, we must continue to garden and sow.
