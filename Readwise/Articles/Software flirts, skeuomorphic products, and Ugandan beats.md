## Highlights
- Skeuomorphic era: in the beginning our first instinct was to create “digital adaptations of pre-internet ideas”. For ex - digital magazines, letter writing, or mail-order shopping.
- Native era: later, we realized the internet was in fact a giant of its own, with characteristics that enable new types of products to form. Social networking, productivity apps, automations, integrations, crowdfunding, etc were all tools built once we collectively grasped the depth and power of the internet as a new tool.
- Skeuomorphic era: decentralized adaptations of products that existed in pre-crypto times. Payment transfers, currency trading, supply chain management, secure storage, all better thanks to blockchain functionalities, but they barely scratch the surface of what Web3 can do.
- Native era: we’re starting to see new native products emerge enabled by innovative tokenization models. Tokens are crucial to Web3 not because they’re currency, but because they’re digital primitives providing ownership to contributors. Examples: DAOs exploring ways to pool funds and collectively govern among strangers, fractionalization of NFT ownership and their utilitarian value, tokenization of carbon offsets making pollution a luxury, among others. Expect more of these to arise as the space gains mainstream popularity.
