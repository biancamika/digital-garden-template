- Shuhari is a model for mastery in Aikido, a Japanese martial art. It has three phases:
  Shu (守): Follow the rule. Imitate the teacher. Don’t deviate from the rules
  Ha (破): Break the rule. Once you know all the rules, break them when necessary. Question rules
  Ri (離): Transcend the rule. Rules are second nature to you. Abandon rules depending on the situation. Further the craft.
