## Highlights
- If we want an educated citizenry that enjoys learning, we need an alternative: we need to inspire people.

- The way I see it, the need for inspiration inverts the learning process: instead of starting with the building blocks and moving toward curiosity, students start with curiosity and move towards the building blocks. Guided by the light of inspiration, the benefits of memorization become self-evident, and the motivation to learn comes intrinsically.

- The Greeks knew this intuitively. They wrapped their most important ideas in narratives instead of sharing them outright. Plays like The Iliad and The Odyssey weren’t just a form of entertainment. They provided cultural instruction too. Since they were passed along in speech instead of writing, they had to be memorized and known by heart.

- From him, I learned that the process of learning is like falling in love with a song. Initially, you’re only attracted to songs that move you emotionally. If they’re catchy, you’ll listen to them enough to get stuck in your head. If the song keeps resonating with you, you’ll learn about the artist and explore the lyrics in depth. Talk to an obsessive and in addition to singing the lyrics for you, they’ll tell you the backstory behind the music.
