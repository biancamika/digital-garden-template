## Highlights
- Every university must have one sacred value, and that value is truth.
- What could be more human than this? In the pantheon of human experiences, I count curiosity as among the most basic, standing alongside even love and loneliness.
- After all, it is curiosity that stimulates the pursuit of understanding. In that sense, curiosity is prior to truth and knowledge alike. Further, it is our respect for the minds of our fellow citizens, for our shared human capacity to dream and wonder—to wonder not only for ourselves but also about ourselves and the different ways our lives might go—that gives our concern for social justice its point. As with truth, so with justice: Curiosity comes first. If there is a single value the university must hold sacred, I submit, it is curiosity.
- It is not only scholarship that is driven by curiosity: learning leans hard on curiosity too.
- Compared with academic teloi such as truth or social justice, curiosity encourages ancillary virtues, patterns of interaction, that are more lovely.
