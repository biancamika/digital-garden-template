## Highlights
- However, the HCD process is owned by tech teams. This immediately limits the scope of the solution because the underlying assumption at any venture-backed tech company is that technology will solve the problem efficiently, while operational processes (like the negotiating and contracting process) remain legacy.

- HCD allowed technologists and their investors to believe that the solution to the complexity of the healthcare system lays in improving consumer perceptions — that the abstraction of technology complete with pastels and a sans-serif font will make things suddenly comprehensible. It allows us to continue funding technological solutions while healthcare's underlying infrastructure continues to crumble.

    - Note: Solving problems through design shouldn’t be surface level!
- our problem-solving begins with two primary constraints — technology and profit — which often lead us to band-aid solutions rather than meaningful change.
