## Highlights
- Historically, the look of software has been reactive, reflecting the ethos of the times.
- As technology advances, software will increasingly be chosen not just for how well it addresses its use case, but how it conveys its personality, similar to how we choose our clothes.
- By designing everything on the screen to be as photorealistic as possible, the software essentially negated needing to define its style or stance — it merely reflected the world outside of it.
- By appealing to everyone with these clean lines, gradients, and rounded shapes, no one feels particularly compelled by them. And while these brands serve their purpose in attracting the “right” demographic to their software, they also make it difficult to form a meaningful connection with the user — the product feels like a stylistic blank slate.
- Style is the indescribable quality that sums up how interacting with something makes a person feel. It isn’t simply sprinkling bits of color or animations on top of enterprise software to move metrics. It’s the feeling the user gets when everything about a product feels specific to a certain personality that they can identify and relate to.
- Evaluating software by its style — and how it makes us feel — signifies a shift to recognizing tech as a part of our society and identity, as opposed to an inanimate tool without an opinion.
