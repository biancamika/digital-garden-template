- In worldbuilding, we are not dealing with prediction or trends. We are looking for arcs of history through present to future at multiple scales that properly represent each unique world. We extrapolate forward to immediate, near, or far future horizons.

- “It is our job to engage the client as a partner in the discovery of their world,” McDowell says. “We take on board their vision, or their intent, or their understanding that the future may violently or radically disrupt their former model” — this is the most common scenario, he says — “but we never predict the outcome, and we encourage every client to remain open to the possibility that the worldbuilding process will discover a completely unexpected outcome. If any client is set in their fantasy, then it will remain a fantasy.”
