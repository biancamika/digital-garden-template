## Highlights
- that we are interdependent, not independent, and it’s foolish to pretend otherwise.
- That I understand the criticism that mindfulness is just a way of helping individuals psychologically cope with broken systems in a broken world, but also: it worked for me.
- I’m also very interested in the idea they expressed that most self-help tells you how to be a better person, but better on the axes of being more productive or more happy (like, a better girlboss), not actually a good person. I would like to see more writing on how to be a good person that is not rationalist-adjacent thinking, that talks about “goodness” in terms of beauty and emotions.
- But I still think contradiction is necessary, that all of us are holding ideas that conflict with each other and that’s just the fucking human condition.
- I think it’s more about trying to find some semblance of coherence in all of the chaos: believing in individualism but also understanding that we are necessarily interdependent, affected by the systems and institutions that we live in.
