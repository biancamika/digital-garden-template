## Highlights
- internet connectivity does not inherently equate to progress.
    - Tags: [[tech]] [[innovation]] 
- The intertanglement of poor technological infrastructure, state subservience to disinformation tactics to manipulate the public, and an oversaturation of internet technologies with insufficient digital literacy training bring developing nations to witness a new level of exploitation.

- Boris Beaude views the internet as a space for “synchrorisation” at a worldwide scale. Where synchronization refers to a shared experience in time, synchrorisation is a common space (Druhle, 2016). As it stands, the internet is the only space that we share globally.

- In these emerging markets, smartphones are more commonly owned; 53% of mobile device owners in the Philippines have smartphones as opposed to 23% with basic phones (Pew Research Center, 2020). Smartphones become a gateway to connection, information, and entertainment.

- This is elevated further in the Philippines, with the population spending an average of about 10 hours a day on the internet, the highest in the world according to a Hootsuite report; social media penetration also stands at 71%––with over 80 million Filipinos exploring the web (CNN Philippines, 2019).

- While public perception and trust in social media platforms has fallen with electoral breaches in North America, the same is difficult to be said for users in the developing world who have it as their only resource and gateway.

- Architecturally, our web gravitates towards centralized operators such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Majority of experiences that one has on the internet take place with these corporations.
    - Tags: [[web]] [[tech]] [[decentralization]] 
- As opposed to a decentralized internet, the tactics deployed by these companies effectively architect the internet into deep, centered holes. Centralized social media sites generate dependence on their platforms, ignoring fundamental issues in access through faux-good will in subsidizing activity that only benefits them in the long-term. In the meantime, digital literacy, energy, and education continue to be abandoned. They are completely barred and in effect, lead "their services to be the whole internet that people know.

- The issue of free information is not a technological one, but an economic one. Access to most content on the internet are theoretically divided by a single click. Nathan Robinson writes about how universal access is a harrowing thing because it takes away from the issue of ownership (Robinson, 2020).

- The design of the centralized web makes it easier for man to follow singular modes of thought, as singular platforms, services, and algorithms manipulate the consumption of the everyday viewer.

- In emerging markets, there is no need for unmoderated and virulent 4chans to awaken hatred. In fact, it wouldn't be efficient. There is already a machine in the form of the gated internet that can fuel the chaos of the web.

- The potential for exploitation here becomes exponentially magnified: not only do platforms like Facebook become the Internet itself, Facebook becomes all the Information that people know.
