## Highlights
- “You don’t solve the human, you solve the problem.”
- It’s not just about interacting with the data. It’s about that intellect, that presence that teaches truthfully, something you cannot replicate with the generic model that exists out there on the internet. It has to be close to a human being, with personal characteristics.
- So time is the most meaningful data structure element that you can use for memories.
