## Highlights
- ‘How can we design systems that give back more than what they take?’ Rather than asking ourselves how we can pollute less or do less harm, we should rethink the systems we operate in and create things that have a restorative impact for their relevant communities.
- Degrowth – it’s a terrible name for a critically important concept. Our economies currently aim for 3% growth every year through inequitable, polluting, extractive methods. Degrowth economists advocate for a steady-state economy that meets the needs of all of its people without relying on infinite growth.
