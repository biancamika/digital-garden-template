## Highlights
- A colonial relationship is: hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative.

- One, they are hierarchical: The companies that produce these technologies also produce an ideology of superiority that data journalist Meredith Broussard calls techno-chauvinism. Techno-chauvinism describes the belief of a small group of fairly homogenous people located primarily in Silicon Valley that they are the best people to deploy a small set of algorithmic applications to administer human life.
- The extractive nature of contemporary technologies also applies to the much more widely covered case of data extraction.
- Everyday forms of exploitation are part of labor relationships in outsourcing programming, in gig economy work, and in the multiple forms of labor that are hidden and ghosted in making technologies appear to function without human assistance.

- They can all be grouped in one way or another under the heading of ‘outsourcing’, which entails sending less lucrative, less interesting, and more dangerous jobs overseas or to peripheral communities.
- Therefore, when we think about colonial relationships, we need to treat the South as both dispersed across the globe and as very particular sites that first developed new ways of coping, refusing, and revisioning these relationships.
- If colonialism is a relationship, rather than a historical time period that is now over, or even a monolithic system of oppression, then those relationships can be shifted through collective action. Some of the ways that you can practice decolonial thinking in your workplace include:
  Radicalize and politicize your ethics — critique, reimagine, practice, repeat
  Join existing movements
  Practice refusal
  Practice extension to others
  Think at the margins of your tasks — what else is going on here?
  Use material practices as a guide
  Begin from pleasure and eros
  Rethink agency — not from without or even against constraint but as counter-conduct
- starting from a place of eros means valuing relationships with others over the indifference that comes from treating one another as disposable, manageable objects.
