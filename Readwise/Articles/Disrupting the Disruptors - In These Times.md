- In a growing number of cities, ​“disruptive” industries have given corporations new ways to exploit workers. Brick-and-mortar schools and universities are threatened with obsolescence by the rise of ​“MOOCs,” short for ​“Massive Open Online Courses.” Taxi drivers now frequently compete with an unlicensed, freelance fleet of ​“Lyft” and ​“Uber” cars. Hotels face AirBnb. News outlets struggle against the Huffington Post.
