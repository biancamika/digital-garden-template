## Highlights
- if everyone goes to college and gets a degree, any credentialing signal that a college degree still has is lost. College becomes the new high school and in fifteen years, we’ll be reading about how the solution to its commoditization is free graduate school in a case of runaway credentialism.
- However, Michael Church argues that American social class consists instead of three parallel ladders, with increasing levels of wealth available at the top: Labor, Gentry, and Elite. Socioeconomic status can vary across the ladders.
- We prefer to talk instead about “democratizing access” and “opening up opportunity.” What’s really important, however, is these social class ideas subtly reveal to you what won’t happen in the future.
- A traditional four year college is not merely a labor market credential. It is a consumption good for parents and students that doubles as a status/class signifier.
- It is a unique consumption good that is imprinted upon children from birth by our society and media to be the culmination and reward for the work they do in K-12.
- A future of “College-for-All” is far more likely than no college.
- there’s so much opportunity for experimentation and unique systems of learning that can be built thanks to the Internet.
- people are given clear options and the ability to succeed based on their unique skills and interests.
- Thinking about edtech through a social class lens can help you understand the demand side without being unrealistic about human preferences and motivations.
- the future of power is going to be outside college through children who go to edtech startups and learn to build the future.
