## Highlights
- Protocols are rules for a system.
- Applications build an easy user interface for people, but they also capture important user data in the process.
- Ok. I'll bite, what's a blockchain? As the name suggests, it's a public database (chain) made from a sequence of transactions (blocks).
- Every event is monitored through proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocols––creating an unchangeable ledger. It's a new form of authenticating information and committing to it.
- A protocol is a fancy word for a standard language, which allows people to work on specific problems. Tokens are software protocols (smart contracts) that enforce rules on a decentralized network (blockchain). Tokens are to internet applications what blockchains are to web servers.
- Cryptography is used to validate the integrity of a message. Private keys unlock the complex algorithms often used to encrypt information.
- Here's how to predict the future: study the incentives.
- Unlike internet protocols, tokens offer a direct way to monetize creators.
- On the other hand, tokens are publicly deployed on a blockchain for anyone to audit.
- Crypto-land is Minecraft for code.
- A
- Crypto is about convenience. While it's quite complex now, the future will be built around simplicity. You're removing an unneeded step in the system: the middleman. Reducing these constraints will improve efficiency, convenience, and value.
