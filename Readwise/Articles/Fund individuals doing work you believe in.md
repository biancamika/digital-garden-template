## Highlights
- While “butterflies” sparkled within traditional systems, moths seemed to be playing games entirely of their own making.
- From the outside, agency is often misinterpreted as ambition, but I learned through observing these two types of people that they are actually quite different. Ambition means you're motivated to play games that others have already created in the world while agency means you're driven to play a game of your own. It quickly became clear to me that our world desperately needs more niche moth-like perspectives and in turn, interesting, actualized visions of the future. What’s more, a moth’s natural inclination to camouflage is core to its success, but it also makes it illegible to the world — which means there's no clear path to become a moth.
- I think agency can be inspired in adults. It just needs different inputs to produce the same infamous outputs: curiosity and creativity. Agency has three core inputs: 1. The hook: consuming a personal narrative that inspires agency 2. The catalyst: receiving the resources and/or validation needed to realize an idea 3. The sustainer: finding community and role models
