## Highlights
- Adorkables are a growing gang of disruptive brands that deftly target Gen Z with a jarring visual aesthetic and an authentic emotional appeal.
    - Tags: [[trend]] [[brand]] [[gen_z]] 
- Because Gen Z was born after 1996, adorkables cluster around beauty (Topicals, Everyday Humans), fashion (Bubble, Entireworld), self-care (Flewd, Superfluid) and snack foods (Nuggs, Behave).

- And because many in Gen Z are CARLYs (Can’t Afford Real Life Yet), there are currently no adorkable car marques or mortgage lenders — nor might there ever be, given the promise of self-driving vehicles and the rising price of real estate.

- adorkables are a subset of “blands” — those direct-to-consumer upstart startups (Quip, Away, Warby Parker, Casper) that, as explored here, claim to be “unique in product, groundbreaking in purpose, and singular in delivery, while slavishly obeying an identikit formula of business model, look and feel, and tone of voice.”

- Two interdependent forces drive Gen Z’s gaze: content creation and social media.

- Unlike genuinely counter-cultural movements (Punk, the Black Panthers, Extinction Rebellion), adorkables have no interest in smashing the system. They simply wish to repackage it for a quirky and suspicious new generation.
