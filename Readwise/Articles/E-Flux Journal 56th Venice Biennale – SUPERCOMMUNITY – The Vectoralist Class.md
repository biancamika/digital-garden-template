## Highlights
- Such is the grand historical story of capitalism, as pretty much everyone has now agreed to call it. Its fanboys now even celebrate its nihilistic torch, rebranded as disruption.
- All that was sacred is profaned—except the ideal of capitalism itself.
- It goes on forever, because in such historical theories, only the proletariat can negate capitalism.
- The proletariat as negating agent has taken different forms in different times.
- In any case, what such theories have in common is the fixed idea that capitalism only comes to an end when it is negated by the force of an agency coming from below.
- Even among those who have paid close attention to differences among the oppressed, and who have taken pains to map out how changes in the mode of production change the kinds of workers who labor within it, there is scant attention to the complexities and changes among the ruling classes.
- perhaps thinking historical change is a matter of multiple classes and class conflicts; perhaps other classes besides capital and labor could be thought of as driving agents of historical change; and perhaps even within capitalism a new kind of class conflict based on a new mode of production could emerge.

- Industry is in a sense more abstract than land. A piece of land is what it is and it is where it is—a topos. A piece of industry is rather more fungible and moveable.
- What if the historical tendency towards a more and more abstract terrain of social production and exploitation did not stop with industry? Under what conditions could it be said that there is a new kind of ruling class?
- Capital and labor transform the once solid world of rural life into the liquid world of industrial second nature.
- Organized labor achieved its victories—the eight hour day, the right to organize, universal suffrage, the welfare state, even the October Revolution—not so much through any ideology or organizational form as through the actual or potential use of this power to shut down the infrastructure of second nature.
- The power of labor was to interrupt the flows—of the assembly line, of the raw materials, of the energy source. Information technology could replace labor in production, and could provide a more flexible and redundant network that would enable industrial capital to move its sites of production away from labor militancy, or to route flows of materials around potential blockages.
- The separation of industry from land produced the abstract terrain of second nature. The separation of information from industry produced a yet more abstract terrain of third nature.
- Second nature is still rather topographic, in that the location of industry is still tied to features of the landscape such as natural harbors or coal and iron deposits. Third nature is rather more topological, in that the dense network of information that overlays the territory enables the landscape to be stretched, compressed, folded, and twisted into new shapes—at least for the purposes of economic activity.
- A line of economic activity becomes a vector, in the sense that it can in principle be deployed anywhere.
- The vector can route around not just labor but capital too. The ascendant power over both labor and capital is the vectoralist class.
- The power of the vectoralist class is in the accumulation of interest, which in this context means not just the return on the investment of information in the form of money but any surplus information, acquired through unequal exchanges of information.
- Based mainly in the overdeveloped world of Europe, and the United States, the vectoral class thrives by extracting surplus information on a global scale. It rarely owns the means of production anymore. The actual making of things can be contracted out.
- The extraction of interest from the unequal exchanges of information requires the constant production of new information. The production of new information is the job of the hacker class.
- As with the landlord in relation to the farmer, and as with the capitalist in relation to the worker, the vectoralist class has to separate the hacker class from that which its shared endeavors makes.
- Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains.
- the history of commodified modes of production can be thought of as passing through three overlapping stages, each of which entails a bifurcation into two classes which polarizes the social field.
