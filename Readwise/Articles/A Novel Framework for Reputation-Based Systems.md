## Highlights
- Reputation systems present an opportunity for platforms to recognize—and thus incentivize—participants’ high-quality contributions, including content creation, moderation, community building, and gameplay.
- Yet designing reputation systems requires complex considerations around reputation supply, distribution, credibility, and more.
- we argue for a reputation system design based on a pair of tokens—one for signaling reputation and the other for offering liquidity—which could serve as tangible representations of meaningful contributions.
- Since the beginning of civilization, we’ve assigned markers of reputation, such as awarding badges for merit or service. In the corporate world, employees are assigned titles or “levels” to indicate their position in the hierarchy—such “tokens” typically determine one’s salary and other
- Players accrue “points” during gameplay that they can convert into in-game “coins” to spend on new skins, weapons, characters, and so forth.
- Importantly, in the crypto context, social tokens can often represent ownership and uniqueness (in the case of NFTs) and, because they are decentralized and portable due to blockchains, social tokens can be used across the global internet economy, rather than just within the confines of a single platform or decision maker.
- To identify and reward the users who have contributed value to the platform—a form of signaling, which those users can parlay into public reputation.
- To provide a form of compensation that enables contributors to liquefy some of the value they have created into an exchangeable currency.
- “Did that person earn their NFT or buy it?”
- if a token can be transferred easily, then those without reputation can simply purchase it, which reduces the token’s ability to serve as a reputation signal.
- high prices can also reduce transferability.
- There’s also currently a natural boundary on the number of people able to enter the space; imagine this issue at scale when more people embrace crypto.
- a decline in reputational capital attached to a token can feed back into the market value of the token. If the token loses its ability to signal reputation, then people become less interested in trading it.
- Thus, establishing reputational capital requires fully (or at least mostly) non-transferable tokens.
- So a second path to signaling value is to make the token substantially easier to obtain if someone has certain underlying characteristics.
- We propose a two-token reputation system, whereby one token, which we call “points,” serves as a non-transferable reputation signal. A second token, “coin,” is a transferable asset dispensed to holders of points on a regular cycle. Effectively, points spin off dividends in coins that can be used as tradable currency. Moreover, because coins accrue to holders of points, coins also have a link to the underlying reputation.
- At a high level, this design promotes a feedback loop whereby users derive points from high-quality contributions on the platform such as contributing content, moderating, or winning gameplay. And then, when the users with points receive coins, they can be traded as a currency. Users’ demand for coins drives the need to acquire points, which in turn incentivizes high-quality contributions.
- scarcity can raise or reinforce the reputation value of the system.
- The three dividend design features—size, supply, and distribution—determine the number of coins a point holder receives in each time period. This relationship directly impacts the incentives to acquire points.
- you should earn points based on how much value you’re creating for the platform.
- a platform would make how much participants earn for their contributions more transparent, so that contributors can assess the value of acquiring points (as well as avoid frustration and burnout).
- those who accumulate points early could end up owning a disproportionate share of the dividends, especially if the asymptotic coin supply is fixed.
- But those early adopters are not necessarily the most valuable to the future of the ecosystem.
- So it is essential to maintain incentives for ongoing contributions and engagement.
- have a user’s point totals decline, either mechanically over time or as a function of the user’s engagement level relative to others.
- With absolute leaderboards, points are zero-sum—if a player does not maintain their contributions, then they eventually lose their standing as other players overtake them. The same is often true on creator platforms, where competition for consumer attention incentivizes ongoing participation.
- point degradation reflects the need for continuing user investment in the platform.
- the value of points depends in large part on the perceived value of coins. Thus, the community’s perception of a coin’s value needs to be at least high enough to back the total coin in distribution.
- every change in the overarching incentive structure for contributors impacts contributor behavior. In particular, anything that degrades point value unexpectedly could harm user trust.
- To make the incentives work, a reputation system should separate social capital from financial capital, particularly if the former offers a clear path to the latter.
- if builders embrace the two-token system design at a high level, they’ll be able to reward contributors with an authentic reputation signal that holds its value even while generating liquidity.
