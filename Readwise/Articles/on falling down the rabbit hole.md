## Highlights
- We can create digital tokens, which enables us to design financial incentive structures for products on the web.
- In web3, you could imagine a teacher that mints tokens based on the number of students they want to take.
- Groups of strangers can come together to make decisions without needing to trust each other, which takes middlemen out of the equation.
- Product functionality is not the moat: the moat is the community and the brand.
- Web3 is a game of primitive composition.
- Because anything that occurs on-chain is attached to an identity, new products can and will be built on top of existing products. In other words, everything is a primitive that can be composed into something new.

- Enduring on-chain products will measure twice and cut once. While blockchains don't have
- Because of this, the products that will make it through waves of scammers/hackers, downswings in token value, and potentially restrictive legislation are those that have prioritized security, built a real use case, and focused on the long-term.
- Crypto enthusiasts often moonlight as game theory nerds.
- Because tokens have monetary value, defining the incentive structure of a protocol defines how its users will act. Folks in the space often discuss incentive design as a result.
- Shill culture is here to stay.
- Money is about belief. [1] Because money is only worth something if everyone believes it's worth something and it's actually being used, people are incentivized to convince everyone else to use crypto as well.
- that's a feature not a bug.
- For starters, mobile experiences basically don't exist, the UI/UX of almost every app is not layperson-friendly and there's little to no onboarding education, and regulation is so up-in-the-air that no one really knows if what they're doing today will be legal tomorrow.
- Web3 is an entirely new internet economy, and economies of scale need infrastructure.
