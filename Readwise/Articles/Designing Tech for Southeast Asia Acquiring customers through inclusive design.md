## Highlights
- I practice inclusive design, which is a design process (not restricted to just tech interfaces) in which a product, service, or environment is designed to be as usable by as many people as reasonably possible, without the need for special adaptations.
- you will need to hyper-localize who you are designing for, whether it is with the local content displayed in your user interface (UI) or the user experience (UX) employed to connect with your audience.
- One way to really get to know your market is to experience their day-to-day lives.
- the tech product should be culturally suited.
- The app may need further adaptation to cater to regional practices such as festivals and observations.
- make sure to value the design and research teams involved.
