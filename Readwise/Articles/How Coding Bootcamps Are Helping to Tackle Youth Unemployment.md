- The bootcamps approach, which lies at the core of rapid technology skills training programs, covers all three facets of the skills gap problem. Firstly, it focuses on rapid training - 9-12 weeks, after which graduates are prepared to undertake the job in the industry. Secondly, it focuses on applied skills - from digital marketing to programming. Thirdly, it places a strong emphasis on career readiness, as bootcamps typically emerge in response to job market needs.
