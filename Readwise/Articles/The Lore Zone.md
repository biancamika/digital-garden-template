## Highlights
- In this way, every livestream with even the most basic participatory user interface, like on Twitch or TikTok, forms an ad-hoc community of synchronized viewers that develop their own micro-body of knowledge and traditions, their own lexicon. In other words, every livestream has the potential to generate lore.
- Forming a semiosphere: developing a vocabulary of memes and shared references that became the semiotic ‘world’ of the livestream. This vocabulary wasn't just limited to concrete objects or templatized phraseology. It included complex abstractions and bespoke emotions. In the case of this particular livestream, it even seemed like certain affects like 'incredulity' and 'begrudging respect' were felt so often by the audience, that they became codified, meme-ified, and satirized.
- Developing a collective body of knowledge: Asking the streamer and the other viewers questions (answered with a unique mix of trolling and sincerity) in order to amass a sort of collective knowledge pool, not just about the Mario game or about ad_god himself, but also about the censorship practices of TikTok itself, and specifically how the app will just block comments containing certain words and phrases.
- Participating in a collective display of nostalgia: Because of the game’s age and cult status, the livestream became a space of collective remembrance where people were compelled to voice their feelings of nostalgia, their own high scores, their lamentation of not having their DS anymore. Many comments were along the lines of “omg, childhood memory unlocked”.
- In other moments, lore from other domains was brought into and integrated with the world of the livestream.
- Lore is intertextual, always referencing and bumping up against the lore of related domains. A body of lore and the community that is associated with it don't always match up one to one, as both are nebulous and ever-evolving. The act of circulating lore is also the act of re-authoring it.
- The mechanisms of lore circulation are extremely dependent on platform and format.
- Lore is history, myth and knowledge on a smaller scale. It permeates laterally through a community, being regulated and disseminated by a centralized body as objective fact. Lore becomes an alternative to mainstream sources of information, be they journalistic, corporate, or governmental. It is in-group knowledge that becomes the backbone of subculture. The size of that subculture can be large in scale, but it is most mysterious / illicit / exciting when it comes from smaller, more exclusive groups, powering people’s motivation to form and identify with contained, tightly-knit communities. Even within the scope of a single livestream, lore connects people by creating personas, narratives, and lexicons that, once legible to you, let you ‘in’ on something—whether that be a joke, a secret or a world.
