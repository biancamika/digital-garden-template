## Highlights
- The tech attitude toward fashion mirrors its underlying faith that individuals’ lifestyles can be optimized just like its products. In making aesthetic, emotional, and social considerations subservient to functionality, this is consistent with tech’s approach to diet (an efficient process of nutrient ingestion supported by “meal replacement” products like Soylent), sleep (an app-quantified segment of the day optimized to maximize waking output), and drug usage (nootropic “brain hacking” to enhance cognitive performance and productivity).

- In his 1964 book Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan wrote that clothing “can be seen both as a heat-control mechanism and as a means of defining the self socially.” In practice, those two functions are intertwined. Even at its most utilitarian — when functioning as a pure “heat-control mechanism” — clothing is still a statement about the conditions we expect to encounter, natural and cultural.

- Fashion is a mode of display that enriches public space and a culture’s shared meanings, but as it enters the culture, it ceases to strictly belong to anyone. It can be observed and often copied without having to pay anyone for the privilege. That is, it creates positive externalities — benefits for which people don’t have to explicitly pay, but can enjoy just by being present in shared space. This acts as a beneficent spiral, with personal style and the public sphere enhancing each other’s significance.

- fashion conveys not just specific trends or an individual’s personal style but a sense of the public itself, of shared space. Fashion implies a desire to see and be seen while affirming the need for public spaces and occasions where that seeing can occur. The manner in which fashion circulates and evolves speaks to the kind of shared reality that we are constituting for one another.

- To the tech world, however, those positive externalities look suspiciously inefficient. These unpaid-for pleasures are externalities that could, with the right technological fixes, be reinternalized and made into someone’s property again.

- Fashion on platforms is simply an informational commodity that translates into algorithmic rankings, ad valuations, and cash transactions.

- It encourages us to see space as contested rather than shared, and to believe, even if just subconsciously, that our own appearance should benefit us at the expense of others and should efficiently integrate our identities into a range of more or less exclusive brand universes.

- The dominant digital platforms comprise a fragmentary array of individualized spaces rather than a true commons, a zone in which the benefits of fashion are quantified via engagement metrics and monetized for capture by creators and consumers. Today, we typically experience this zone in the form of feed-based social media, a crude substitute for physical reality that is correspondingly limited in its ability to function as ersatz public space.

- That is, the “metaverse” serves as would-be branding for this more robust facsimile of public space where a broader range of social expression can be more readily captured and monetized. Instead of a departure from atomized, feed-based social media, this version of the metaverse aspires to be its apotheosis, an environment where “presence” itself is proprietary.
