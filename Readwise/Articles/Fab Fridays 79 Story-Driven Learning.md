## Highlights
- But it’s not the natural way we learn. We weren’t designed in a laboratory to follow code. We evolved to learn by mimicking.
- When ancient humans wanted to pass on knowledge, they shared stories of heroes for their kids to copy.
- Stories make knowledge memorable and practical. They give us heroes we want to emulate.
- First, they made the subject come alive with captivating illustrations. Maybe they shared from their own experience, talked about history or the news, or showed examples in class. Second, they gave you the freedom to practice what you were learning. You could take what they showed you and apply it yourself.
- With stories, you learn how successful people achieved their greatest accomplishments—and what caused their greatest failures.
