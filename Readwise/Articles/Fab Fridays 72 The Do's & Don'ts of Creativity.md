## Highlights
- But creativity is not a natural born-talent. It’s a mindset that gives us a sense of inventiveness and excitement.
- Toys like LEGOs teach kids to follow instructions, not create new inventions.
- When there are no constraints on the creative process, complacency sets in.
- Find the right balance between unstructured activities and creative challenges with constraints so that kids feel motivated to spend some more time generating novel ideas.
- When you don’t ask questions, you signal to kids that what they made matters more than why they made it. But creativity isn’t about colors and shapes. It’s about forming a unique point of view.
- What steps did your kid take? What decisions did they make along the way? What was their inspiration? Their strategies? Help kids hone their process and it'll serve them for life.
