## Highlights
- Beyond the obvious labor cost savings, the Philippines is an attractive destination for tech jobs, particularly for American companies, because of its young, educated workforce and its English-speaking population (the fifth largest on the planet). Unlike other outsourcing hubs, Filipinos are intimately familiar with American culture, a legacy of more than 30 years of American colonial rule.

- Traditionally, business process outsourcing was associated with high-volume, low-price work. Today, the mainstream appeal of Silicon Valley is turning young Filipino workers who might have been satisfied with a call center job a decade ago into a creative and entrepreneurial class seeking a deeper connection with innovation-driven and mission-focused companies. Working for a venture-backed start-up is the new status symbol.

- Because of the ubiquity of English, product managers have found it relatively quick and easy to use the Philippines as a test market to deploy and iterate new applications without the need for translation into a non-English language.

- The Philippines is a natural gateway to the broader Southeast Asia market. Filipinos share a common ethnicity with other Southeast Asian countries. But it’s also the most westernized country in the region. This makes it a fertile testing ground for a product that can scale to other emerging markets
