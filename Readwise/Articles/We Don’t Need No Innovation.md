## Highlights
- “innovation” continues to circulate in popular discourse as a self-evident rationale for disrupting schools and school systems.
- “Hunger isn’t new. Torn pants aren’t new. They aren’t innovative. Therefore, there are no funds for that kind of problem.”
- The ostensible goal of ES70 and similar postwar reform efforts may have been to modernize schools, but the larger aim was always to enroll K-12 education into a nascent project of national innovation.
- How might West Philadelphia and its schools be different, today, if innovations fifty years ago had centered the material concerns of its residents: community control, equitable resourcing, small class sizes, racially and linguistically diverse teachers, and culturally sustaining instruction? What even more radical possibilities were preempted by the mode of “innovation” that gripped the district instead?

- alternate frame for educational innovation: where the as-yet-unrealized project of free, just, and democratically controlled education for all stands as the measure against which any proposed reforms are judged. If “innovation” is to be anything more than a buzzword—or a Trojan horse for austerity measures, urban development, and workforce production—it must be rooted in such a commitment to the self-determination and flourishing of the publics that schools are meant to serve.
