## Highlights
- Zuckerberg’s virtual world of play pretend is a way of escaping the destruction he’s wrought on the real one.
- These kinds of social worlds remain a niche concern (in part because few social interactions are improved by a soupcon of headset nausea).
- A case in point: the globe has been living with working from home for 18 months, and in that time there have been thousands of hi-tech offerings that attempt to recreate the office, yet every major company is still opting for the dreary Zoom call. That’s because VR is inherently silly and most work isn’t.
