## Highlights
- AI promises to usher in an era of peace and plenty for humanity that frees us from the burden of labor and need, provided we play our cards right to avoid the risk of existential catastrophe.
- Meanwhile, blockchain provides the infrastructure for, we are told, the unparalleled exercise of both individual and collective agency, opening the doors to automation, self-governance and global coordination.
- Autonomy is necessarily circumscribed by community and society. Meaningful independence only exists through interdependence, one that is impossible in the worlds these technological visions imagine.
- Humans have very little “traditional” political autonomy in this view. Instead, human autonomy is expressed as autonomy from need — a freedom from the daily toil of being human, as AI replaces “humans at most economically valuable work,”
- “Decentralization,” as Nathan Schneider describes it, at first encompassed the principles of transparent, open-source, permissionless access to digital infrastructure, but has transformed into a plastic political philosophy that seeks to maximize autonomy through political freedom, freedom of choice and voluntary association.
- “The more we aim for a future free from human messiness, the more we push humanity away in the present.”
