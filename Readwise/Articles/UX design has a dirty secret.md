## Highlights
- UX Theatre is easy to spot: It’s the application of any sort of design methodology without including a single user in the process, or including users but merely for show.
- First, user experience design is a vague concept and isn’t as well defined as something like accounting or law.
- The struggle to define our practice clearly among ourselves, let alone explain it to non-practitioners, can actually hinder our ability to integrate user experience design deeply into the workings of our organizations.
- however Design Thinking is often adopted as a substitute for actual user-centered design, with activities being led internally and without users, ultimately resulting in UX Theatre.
- The second issue that leads to UX Theatre is that design is touted as something everyone can do.
- In Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change, Victor Papanek wrote, “All men are designers. All that we do, almost all the time, is design, for design is basic to all human activity.” This sentiment was meant to convey that humans all have the ability to think in a designerly way and that design is an inherently human activity.
- When organizations adopt the perspective that “everyone is a designer,” user experience design is less recognized as a practice led by skilled practitioners and perceived more as a thought process that anyone can adopt and implement.
- In this case, bad UX begets no UX. It’s a destructive cycle.
