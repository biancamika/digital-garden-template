## Highlights
- I’m thinking about the ‘form’ of the experience.
- With omakase, the chef makes the call. There is no menu anxiety, no trying to decipher strange names, no haggling over who should order what. You sit back, relax, and entrust yourself to the creativity and craftsmanship of the chef.
- (Ultimately, our economy is only as strong as the trust inside of it.
- If people want to pay you a premium price to put themselves in your hands and let you create what you truly want to create, then you’ve done something truly special.
- market demand is the product of a reflexive process between what is on offer (the supply) and what people want (the demand).
- Desires are formed, not born out of nothing—not created ex nihilo. We are all responsible for what one another wants.
- That’s why the greatest role of an entrepreneur is shaper of desires—thin and thick.
- Frederick Buechner defines a vocation as the place where “your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.”
- Life is a process of continually understanding and developing our desires.
- The problem with the Lean Startup as a mindset is that it leads to a Minimal Viable Life.
- The Lean startup is a mental model that is ultimately not helpful for human flourishing. There are metaphysical, creative, and moral issues with it.
- Who doesn’t want to be get paid for doing what they love? For creating and shaping the market? The alternative is letting the market shape you.
- So metaphysical desire—a key category in mimetic theory—would be the type of desire that transcends physical things. It’s a desire for being. We could also call it spiritual desire.
- Do we believe that we’re merely the servants of some abstract ‘market’, and that those who ‘meet demand’ the best are the real winners? Or do we view ourselves as agents of change?
- The best entrepreneurs are not merely pill pushers or umbrella sellers. They’re not opportunists; they’re creators. Demand is created. Desires are created. And we have a choice about what it is that we are going to supply.
- These chefs wins—we all win—because of the shared culture, the things we learned along the way, the daringness to take risks and give people something they might not like.
- If there are no sources of morality in our culture beyond the mimetically-popular norms—or the particular sub-communities that we’re a part of—then it’s curious how we make any moral progress at all.
- Omakase is an approach to business and to life that takes a stand. I view it as a moral stand, actually. I’m not talking about overfishing or ethical food systems here. I’m referring to moral questions about what it means to be human—about whether we’re human, or whether we’re dancer.
- Creators with a strong moral compass necessarily have to be anti-mimetic in many ways.
- Are we making the things that we truly want to make, or are we making the things that we’re mimetically-driven to make?
