## Highlights
- Tech lowers the barrier of entry to expertise, but not the bar
- The first rule of thinking: At any given point in time, you should be working on at least one thing via first-principles thinking. It might take you the rest of your life. But having at least one thing to go deep on is a life well lived.
- The second rule of thinking: When relying on proxies — which is likely the case for over 99% of what you believe — vary your proxies. Variation increases the likelihood that the proxies end up disagreeing with each other on important truths.
- The trouble with recognizing expertise? We can’t distinguish great teachers
- The best scholars are those who have a single-minded focus, strive to learn everything about that thing, and change how we see it. To paraphrase the famed Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget: If you work to become an expert in one thing, however narrow, you gain the ability to be an expert in anything — you’ve trained your brain to organize knowledge effectively.
- The best way to recognize an expert is to be one. The best way to become an expert is to learn from experts who are themselves brilliant teachers. The challenge is that people are not experts in what makes a great teacher.
- Thus, truly great teachers are often known only by a select community: other experts in the field and former students. Too few people inside and outside the education sector talk about what makes a great teacher and what makes great teaching. What we need is future thinking that focuses not only on what makes a great teacher, but what will make that great teaching available to all.

- Whenever an expert was describing a complex idea, Feynman asked for a concrete example. Then he followed the example along in his mind as they built back up to the idea itself. Not infrequently, the example would reveal obvious flaws or gaps in the idea, and he would interrupt. Even if the idea was sound, the example clarified it. By moving from the concrete to the abstract instead of the other way around, Feynman excised insight from unnecessary complexity. He unlocked the value expertise was supposed to offer, even when it didn’t.
- Humanity has so much profound understanding locked inside expert silos, and narrative is a crowbar that can pry them open for the rest of us.
- The command and deep understanding of a subject has been decoupled from credentialism. Experts can be born and brought up on the internet, bypassing post-secondary institutions and other centralized forms of education and knowledge dissemination.
- Additionally, the rate at which the internet allows for information to be generated and spread means new fields are emerging at lightning speed, with academic and government institutions unable to keep pace. In these new domains, people are not turning to universities or federal departments to learn — instead, they’re often looking to individuals who are taking an internet-first approach to acquiring and sharing expertise.
- The generative intellectual environments that academic institutions house and foster are being recreated or entirely rethought online, outside of the brick walls of a university. Internet salons, writer collectives, open-source software, fellowships, and cohort-based courses are providing modern alternatives to those institutions. You don’t need an MSc or PhD to join, just HTTP.
- But the internet has become an institution of its own that’s reshaping who can become an expert, how they share their expertise, and the ways they can earn a living from it.
- Knowledge-holders thus become “public experts” instead of “institutional experts,” trading a higher level of visibility for a greater degree of scrutiny. By maintaining a constant dialogue with the public rather than a closed discussion within institutions, experts can learn from audiences, sharpen their ideas from critique, and update more quickly based on new information.
- The wisdom of crowds is giving way to the “wisdom of communities.” In a world of ever-greater complexity, no one person can possibly make sense of all the signals and all the noise — from a single, static vantage point. A networked group is required to adapt to this new world.
- If the wisdom of crowds is a form of ‘averaging out’ each person’s abilities, then the wisdom of communities is a way to compound them.
- This is how expertise will come to be defined: less and less by what any one individual knows, and more by the (compounded) insights of broad, distributed communities who may also have vested stakes in their shared ambitions.
- Traditional expertise is as much about belonging to a community of experts as it is about knowledge.
- This raises two important questions for the future of expertise: First, how do we build better intuitions and norms around when to rely on traditional expertise and when to look further afield? Second, how do we build better tools and institutions for distinguishing “contrarian and correct” from “crank”?
- For some types of research, it’s now possible to pursue PhD-level work outside of formal academic institutions. You don’t need a title to demonstrate expertise: you just need to show your work … Someone who’s taken the time to deeply understand a murky, underexplored niche — then sharing what they’ve learned in public — can get much further than someone with a fancy-sounding title but little practical experience.
- Expertise isn’t going anywhere: we’re just finding new ways to measure and signal it. There’s a lot more noise in expertise today. Easy access to information means everyone is a superficial expert on everything. But if you’ve put in the hours to understand your topic and can demonstrate what you know, no amount of credentialing, outgrouping, or gatekeeping can take that away from you.
- The current distrust of experts is part of a broader breakdown in the social contract between science and society.
- Science is being played as a finite game when it could, and should, be infinite.
- “metascience” — applying a scientific rigor and lens to the processes of science itself
- We need applied metascientists, people who build new tools and models, in addition to just studying the current systems.
- The promise of the internet was less human friction. Instead, we got constant networking on every platform.
- What moves an artist forward is defining a professional trajectory and then making human connections toward these targets. It’s called many things — grit, ambition, tenacity — a primal survival instinct in a jungle of talent.
- But if you have something to say, do your own thing. It will create a space with a different set of metrics, defined solely in service of your artistic vision.
- Trust has to be earned and reinforced rather than simply assumed. In the absence of forceful and persuasive explanation, trust will inevitably dwindle. This goes for everything from disease control to journalism. Treating any field as a black box whose inner workings are opaque is a terrible idea in an era of mass mistrust.
- We’re not dealing with a crisis of expertise itself as much as a crisis of explanation. Far too many disciplines have run face-first into their inability to make the general public understand what they’re saying and why … Treating any field as a black box whose inner workings are opaque is a terrible idea in an era of mass mistrust.
- The average city resident often has a better understanding of how a city should feel, of what would make them feel safe and content, than urban planners today … It’s clear that “expertise” needs to be more about practical, ground-up insights than just top-down planning or research.
- Still, experts should be careful not to underrate personal stakes in their decision-making. I love the idea of “method acting”, but for experts, to consistently marry academic expertise and practical, local knowledge by regularly immersing themselves within the communities they seek to serve.
- To reach a healthy, balanced place with experts, you can use a method that I use: Take their expertise as an input. Test it against your own thoughts. Test it against other experts’ ideas. Then mix and match and blend and throw out and remix until you come up with your own ideas.
- We live in a world where expertise can be justly claimed by anyone who can continue to prove it. Synthesis and storytelling are the keys to navigating that world. In a world with so much information available and fewer unquestioned experts, the ability to let large amounts of information wash over you, figure out where to dive deep, pull out the most compelling bits, and tie them all together is key.
- Genuine experts must be willing to engage horizontally with the masses and the public as active participants — defending and interacting around their expertise — rather than treating the public as mere passive recipients of their knowledge production.
- Expertise remains crucial to knowledge production, but it must reflect genuine excellence in a given field, rather than mere affiliation with institutional authority.
- These related trends naturally lead to a new set of skills that will become crucial to navigating the modern world and becoming a genuine expert in a new paradigm: Intellectual humility (rather than know-it-all-ism); genuine curiosity (rather than reflexive, orthodox thinking); and the willingness to openly admit error (rather than defensive stubbornness or dismissiveness that masks insecurity of one’s own fading authority). All this, and an acute and constantly refined bullshit detector.
- But organizations and people are inherently change-averse, so knowing how to manage change is arguably a more crucial type of expertise than knowing how to execute (creatively or technically) on the change itself. Because it’s easier to know what to do than how and when to do it — and much, much harder to know how to help others do it.
- Liquidity is powerful: Having property rights (tokens/currency), proving those property rights (blockchain), and re-selling those rights (liquidity) were the missing pieces to create entirely new gaming economies, as well as new gameplay strategies (like play-to-earn).
- it. Today, clear-mindedness has become a learned skill that is essential to navigating media, both social and traditional. It’s something to be worked on, developed, and mastered. In practice, that means the ability to pause and think, rather than reflexively accepting what the machine is shouting at you; the ability to seek and interrogate alternative viewpoints through reading widely; and the ability to defer judgment until you have absorbed competing arguments via introspective consideration.
- The paradox is that the best kinds of leaders we can hope for are the ones who accept their ignorance — and publicly share their best attempts to overcome it.
- When we think of expertise, we should think expansively. This is not to say that experts themselves should no longer be valued, but instead that value should be determined through the consensus of many. Consider the vital forms of social and economic organization that have developed through distinct cultures passing down traditions, histories, and generational knowledge. These forms of collective expertise don’t rely on pedigree or exclusivity, nor do they require an individualist philosophy or spokesperson. Group resiliency and peer-to-peer knowledge — often shared between families, neighborhoods, indigenous and regional cultures, and friend groups — have long been capable of manifesting futures that would have been impossible to achieve alone.
- That said, decentralization should also require that we reconfigure traditional hierarchies of expertise, which can lead to more meaningful frameworks and models for communication, valuation, and exchange. Where web2 users don’t retain value from their creative labor, web3 offers us the type of expertise we need today, a collaborative one — one that can be shared throughout digital communities via decentralized technologies such as peer-to-peer networks, decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs), and community tokens. Ideally,
- Shared expertise is capable of catalyzing cultural movements, resulting in greater opportunities for all. We have a chance to create a different kind of container for what “expertise” is intended to do altogether, by promoting expertise without necessarily centering the expert. Imagine the creative potential of operating according to this principle: a collective redefinition of expertise that could also represent a collective redefinition of value.
- But expertise is not a static thing; it must evolve over time. Those who are revered for their expertise today must continually refresh themselves and their knowledge, or their perspectives will expire. Rather than giving credence to people who achieved expert status in the past — much like old gaming systems rewarded the whales only — we should be looking to those who are constantly renewing their skills, and revisiting their own competencies, to see their ongoing adaptability as credible instead.
- Access and expertise (they are often the same thing) shouldn’t be about a college degree, or a job title, or even how many years of experience you have in a given field. It should be about curiosity, learning, and being able to share what you learn with others and build up others.
- With only a few essential keys to keep on hand, anyone can be transformed into a New Expert. These keys are fourfold and include keeping in mind that: 1. Replication is the gold standard in science; 2. Nonpartisanship is the key to understanding partisan issues; 3. The social media accounts of business leaders tell more about a business-oriented mind than contrived, PR-directed talks and appearances; and 4. The idea that the “latest is the greatest” when it comes to finding quality information and staying up to date on almost any subject matter.
