## Highlights
- Odell defines “manifest dismantling” as overturning the legacy of misguided thinking about the economy that has caused the problems we are facing now such as the issues that are intertwined and emerge within public space, environmental politics, class, and race.  Additionally, the politics of technology that are entangled with the politics of public space and the environment.  Furthermore, manifest dismantling considers the effects of the attention economy and the ways in which these effects play out in other aspects of inequality.
