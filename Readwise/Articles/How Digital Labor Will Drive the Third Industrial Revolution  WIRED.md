## Highlights
- The kind of robot I’m talking about isn’t clanking around the office taking up space and typing on a keyboard. Rather, it is a robot embedded in software, capable of reading screens, writing administrative programs, communicating with others, and generally carrying out work with the same technologies as their human counterparts. This is perhaps a digital echo of Henry Ford’s production line, in which manufacturing was de-skilled to a series of simplified repetitive tasks, which could be physically demonstrated and then copied, in many cases without the need for spoken language.
- The list of routine administrative tasks that this kind of “assistance “can tackle is vast. Any process that is repetitive and does not require judgment is a good candidate for robots. Data entry, account review and maintenance, creation of user IDs and passwords, general ledger account maintenance and issuing of purchase orders are examples of tasks suited for execution by robots. These tasks are major components of the modern office.
