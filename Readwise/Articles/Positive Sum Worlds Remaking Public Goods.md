## Highlights
- Some of the crypto community's stated ambitions are to solve mass coordination problems, build post-national forms of sovereignty, and level the global playing field. But to create a majestic and egalitarian society requires a more expansive vision of public goods than what can be imagined with economics alone.
- As builders of a new digital society, we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what "public" and "good" can mean.
- A social body is united not only by the things it makes use of, but by a multitude of shared traits, including geography, ethnicity, religion, taste, culture, history, and values. This is why, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always local.
- Locality is created and felt through shared space, time, or experience. Without the assumptions and norms that develop out of this shared context, it would be impossible to identify and make space for things that are in the public benefit. So public goods, even as defined by economists, will always be a reflection of some group's shared context, common beliefs, and moral sensibilities; in other words, their value system.
- If public goods are to satisfy shared values, then public discussion of what's of value matters!
- A value system is fostered through storytelling and negotiation in forums of public discourse.
- Greater scale should mean greater good as valued by an increasingly wider set of people: the creation of positive externalities.
- externalities are more nascent. Today, core contributors to open source projects are still under-funded, despite entire industries being built with their
- Understanding public goods as positive externalities enables us to consider people that are not typically classified as members of a public to be our beneficiaries.
- Positive externalities are thus an important variation on a familiar theme in the crypto space: positive sum games. By now, most crypto-natives recognize that relationships and value creation are largely of this type, games of building and shilling where contributions have cooperatively additive effects.
- This leads us to a surprising feature of this new form of public goods: one way to manifest positive externalities is to consider the success of others as your own.
- If public goods always serve a set of values local to some userbase, we might find our best inspiration by looking at the publics we already are part of.

- But if we apply our principle of "positive externalities" to include future citizens of the places we live, protocol-built public goods starts to look more like community-driven industrial policy.
- The Ethereum project envisioned a "world computer," a coordination system for global prosperity.
- Cathedrals, great canals, sanitation, the expansion of mass literacy—they tell us that the "goodness" of a public good is also measured in terms of its longevity. To match these great works, we must extend our time horizon.
- Public goods are enacted by social institutions that reproduce patterns of behavior in the public interest.
- As tokenholders, we have the right and the responsibility to ask what these assets should be used for—and the stakes are high.
- The type of social institution needed is not an on-chain corporation, but a container for a different idea of what capital and coordination is intended to do altogether.
- In today's world, capital is not scarce; ambitious visions for the public's benefit are.
