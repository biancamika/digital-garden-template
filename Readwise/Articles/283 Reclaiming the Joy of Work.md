## Highlights
- When I think about "work," I think about making progress towards a meaningful goal.
- Work essentially comes in two forms. Work that is not meaningful to you, and thus should be completed to the minimum acceptable threshold with the least energy possible. And work that is very meaningful to you, in which case you should pour your heart and soul into it.
- But thinking of hard work as always driven by some unhealthy obsession with gold-star-chasing misses the beautiful side of work. Work that is driven by an intense, intrinsic desire to achieve some goal.
- for a good infinite game. Something I loved doing as an end in itself, and which was self-rewarding without having to be purely money or status driven.
