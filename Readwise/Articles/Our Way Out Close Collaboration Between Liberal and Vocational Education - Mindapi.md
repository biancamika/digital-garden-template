- Liberal education, manifested in the form of universities and colleges, exist as a space and time for students to expose themselves to a wide array of disciplines, prepare students for a continuously-changing democratic society, and learn from professors whose work isn’t driven by profit-maximization.

- Vocational education, manifested in the form of bootcamps and many microcredentials, helps a handful of students gain extra practical skills and “package” their learnings to match the demand of the labor market.
