## Highlights
- In Democracy and education, Dewey described the main basis of all education as the "reconstruction or reorganization of experience which adds to the meaning of experience and which increases the ability to direct the course of subsequent experiences". As simplified by Hlebowitsh, the "reconstruction or reorganization of experience" is really just a way of saying that one must learn from one's experience in a fashion that avoids repeating mistakes and that contributes to one's ability to make more informed decisions in the future.

- For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. He believed that these human life experiences are the contribution to how an individual makes informed decisions on future situations.

- As part of his vision for democratic education, Dewey believed that education should do more beyond training students to fill a job. He believed that learning should be deeply personal and students should learn a broad range of subjects to allow them to participate in greater democracy. This was in contrast to the administrative progressive who favored a more pragmatic view on educated: a vocational approach in order to train workers to fuel the economy.
- In response to this, Dewey wrote 2 articles to address vocational education. Dewey argued that vocationalists like Snedden erred in two respects:
  their vision of vocational education is too closely allied with the interests of industrialists to serve the greater public interest, and
  it suggests an imprudent approach to educational reform, whereby no meaningful change is ever forthcoming. Vocationalism merely props up the status quo, a disappointing state of industrial relations warranting the continued exploitation of workers by management.
- The purpose of democracy is so to organize society that each member may develop his personality primarily through activities designed for the well-being of his fellow members and of society as a whole.

- This line of thinking falls into Snedden's view of education and society: people are either consumers or producers. In this model of education, education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty; the status quo is always upheld. When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.
- On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that with proper rich education experience, people will be better equipped to cure social ills that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.
