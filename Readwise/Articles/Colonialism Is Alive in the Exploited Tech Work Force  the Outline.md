## Highlights
- Silicon Valley’s content moderation labor chain depends on a fundamental colonial principle: forced acculturation and assimilation.

- Thus, the global tech infrastructure that tech companies have built that exploits outsourced social media content moderators and tech workers in Global South formerly colonized countries is a vestige of U.S. and British colonialism — one that massively wealthy Silicon Valley tech companies exploit for their own profit.

- Content moderation is not simply a “low-skill” job — it is a role that requires a kind of cultural fluency and an ability to filter content that is likely to offend a particular audience’s sensibilities.

- In fact, the Philippine’s colonization by the U.S. has been explicitly touted as a reason to outsource tech and content moderation to the Philippines, because it creates a “strong affinity to Western culture” and English language fluency, which in turn supposedly enables workers to better screen American and Western social media content. Thus, the exploitative labor of Filipino and other former U.S. and U.K. colonies can be understood as a symptom of the continued wound of colonialism.

- Thus, the violence of colonialism, including efforts such as Christian proselytizing, English language schools, and the erasure of indigenous Filipino culture and language, has created both the cultural and economic contexts in which Facebook and other corporations turn to cheap, acculturated, colonized labor.

- This system of Western consolidation of data, intellectual property, and platforms thus consolidates what has become known as “digital colonialism” — one unsurprisingly underpinned by the underpaid labor of formerly colonized peoples.

- Silicon Valley’s modern colonial labor chain is a reminder that white supremacy in tech doesn’t just come from its users: the legacy of colonialism is alive and well in Silicon Valley’s hidden chambers abroad.
