## Highlights
- The innovative entrepreneursâ€™ labour in turn is seen not as exploited capitalist labour, but as a creative process more akin to art (Kunda, 2006; Saxenian, 1994).

- Given the harsh conditions of flexible labour, we contend that often such flexibility is not chosen by creative workers but imposed on them by capital. In fact, some studies have already concluded that a majority of creative workers would actually prefer more traditional, secure, long-term employment, but employers increasingly prefer systems of outsourcing and short-term labour contracts, which allow them to avoid the costs associated with a permanent labour force (Banks, 2007; Gill, 2007; Perrons, 2003).
