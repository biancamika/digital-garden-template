## Highlights
- By “autonomy” I mean the freedom to make work that I think is good on my own terms.
- Creativity is inherently anti-authoritarian. As in: to be successfully creative, you have to shed the part of yourself that desperately wants reassurance.
- To write in a real voice, an alive voice, I have to trust my own eyes, what I see before I start to think.
- autonomy comes from trust in the self, in subjective vision. It’s a rejection that the answer lies in any narrative framework.
