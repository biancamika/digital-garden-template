## Highlights
- the extensive handing-around by supportive people that is involved in getting any piece of writing into the world.
- The short answer is mismanaged priority lists. We tend to let our lists be dominated by things that are urgent, that require immediate action. Things that are profoundly important but don’t require immediate action—like maintenance—go so far down the list they seldom get dealt with, or they get only half-hearted, feeble attention.
- Maintainers are habitual long-term thinkers.
