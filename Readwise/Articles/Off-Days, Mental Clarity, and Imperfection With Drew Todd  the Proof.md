## Highlights
- Mental clarity is working smarter and not harder. Think: peak operation, optimizing the day, and focusing on the tasks at hand.

- On the other hand, spirituality is finding that sense of purpose. For most of my life, I was searching for purpose and didn’t feel fulfilled or spiritually connected. 
  Once I found what I was deeply passionate about, everything spiritually clicked. 
  I now see spiritual clarity as finding peace within yourself, and knowing that you’re contributing to something that truly resonates with your core.
