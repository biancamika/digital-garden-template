*What does it mean to be intense? How does our essence, tools, and longevity shape it?*

#personaldevelopment #life 

+ On intense people: how they think, act, carry themselves is something that's very them. In short, someone is intense because **they are in touch with their ==essence.==**
+ The problem is **most of life beats our intensity out of us.**

> Like physics, **civilization accumulates more tools as it progresses.** We don’t teach children the spirit of how to go about living life, but instead make them go through lengthy education (Not everyone needs college, but we all need better K-12). ==**We are pushed into shaping our lives with so many tools, without knowing that we can make our own tools or not use them at all.**== That’s how our intensity is diluted.

> Furthermore, when everything is at the click of a button, **we stop exercising our judgement and opt for the most convenient.** Instead of downloading MP3s and picking the best songs for our limited storage, we just let random Spotify playlists run through our minds. Instead of stumbling upon hidden gems we never knew we wanted in bookstores, we just rely on algorithms to find the bestsellers. “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.” ==**When we fail to exercise our judgement in choosing our tools, what does that say about the person we become?**==

> It’s why working on longevity is important. **If we know life lasts for hundreds of years, wouldn’t we nurture our essence more and refuse to let the world lessen our intensity?** We would take time to curate and build tools fit for us, time to truly define our ambitions, time to shape the beautiful buildings that we want to create in this world.

+ Beautiful buildings are inefficient in the short term, but efficient in the long term
	+ Things built for the short temr will simply be torn down, and descend into cultural malaise

+ it's essential to invest time into making your inputs and environment reflect your essence, even if it seems unproductive on the surface. 
	+ spruce up your workspace
	+ seek new books
+ Breaking down how:
	+ Start with mindset: *"You have a hundred years left to live ahead of you"*
	+ sort through the inputs you receive from the world and make sure they are as unadulterated as possible.
		+ in a world of algorithmic dominance, choose small acts of rebellion
			+ timeline -> lists
			+ restaurant discovery without Yelp
			+ listen to only downloaded music
			+ pick up books you've never heard of
	+ Above all, **create.**

> Above all, create. Write, research, code — it's only through creating that you can extract your essence and manifest it into the world. **==Creating is ultimately an act of longevity.==** Your creations reflect who you are and you yourself become your creations. As you revise them through the feedback loops of the world, you refine your essence as well, waking up one day amazed at your transformation. That’s how you become more intense, more you. When you seek intensity, you might surprise yourself with versions of yourself you never imagined existed.

+ E.G. FAANG stocks
+ **the world rewards you for outcomes, not effort.** 
+ When you insist on working hard, even when it's not the most effective strategy, **you miss obvious solutions that are right in front of your eyes.**
+ Whenever you're trying to solve a problem, ask yourself: "What am I missing because it feels too stupid?"

> Writing about the precise quantification of time, John Gatto once said: "Bells destroy the past and future, rendering every interval the same as any other, as the abstraction of a map renders every living mountain and river the same, even though they are not."

#education #creativity 

+ school bells show how **the clock can crush the creative spirit.** You can't get lost in your work when you're hyper-aware of the clock.
+ To the creative mind, seconds are not equal. 
	+ An hour spent writing when you're sharp in the morning can be worth three hours of writing when you're tired in the evening. 
	+ An hour spent writing at the tail end of a retreat, when you have the context of an entire book loaded into your mind, can be worth ten hours of ordinary writing time.
