- Design justice also focuses on the design of systems
- Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.

**Design Education**
- Rather than teaching rules, design education should prompt students to investigate where problems stem from and how to solve them inclusively
- radical educator Paulo Freire
- Freire writes, “the goal of education is to transform oppressed individuals into subjects who engage in collective action to transform their conditions of oppression.”
- education lives within a system of domination and liberation; each participant should think, question, and act to identify the causes of the problems within that system.
- Designers should keep the following principles in mind: change emerges over time from a collaborative process, rather than appearing out of thin air at the end; we should facilitate change without presuming to be the expert; everyone in the design process should share their perspectives; and most importantly, we should finding out what’s already working and uplift those systems.
