## Internet Age Institutions
+ [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/) story: don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand. 
+ We must go back and understand more clearly ==what kinds of institutions we may need== to keep our world wide web safe to walk through gaily.
+ Instituions need not be things like The Federal Reserve, or a government department, or a place you go when you need to spend some time separate from society. 
+ We have - for instance - the institution of marriage: which is ==a **practice** or a **custom**.== It is in this sense which we will be using the word for the rest of Module 4.
+ The internet routes information around slow-moving bureaucracies and so requires that ==we update the practices and customs we use to relate to one another and **organize ourselves.**==
+ It has caused critical shifts in three spheres of human life:
	+ How we identify ourselves
	+ How we reach consensus
	+ How we experience time
+ Through the language of hierarchy (meaning no rulers, not no rules), views of institution-as-practice or custom can be collected under the term ["counterpower"](https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf)

> Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ==ways of publicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and transforming it into social states (or if you like, forms of value) that society sees as the most desirable:== conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity, beauty, however it may be framed.

Focussing in on the notion of custom and conviviality, we can tur to Ivan Illich for another important perspective on the critical words for this week, **commons** and **custom**:

> A commons is not a public space. ==A commons is a space which is established by custom.== It cannot be regulated by law. The law would never be able to give sufficient details to regulate a commons. A typical tree on the commons of a village has by custom very different uses for different people. The widows may take the dry branches for burning. The children may collect the twigs, and the pastor gets the flowers when it flowers, and the nuts from it are assigned to the village poor, and the shadow may be for the shepherds who come through, except on Sundays, when the Council is held in the shadow of the tree.

> The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. **Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.**

## Govern Yourself
People think governance is hard. Which is correct - it's the most complex topic in Web 3. This is because, ==by virtue of complementary opposites, it is also the most simple.== It is so obvious that everyone misses it. Lao Tzu explains best:

*To give no trust
is to get no trust.*

*When the workâ€™s done right,
with no fuss or boasting,
ordinary people say,
Oh, we did it.*

### Anarchy
+ The Cypherpunks were almost all [anarchists](https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf)
+ They believed that, ==if you build tools which give people the means to govern themselves, then good governance at higher levels is the inevitable result.==
	+ Individual sovereignty allows for emergent forms of organization which are more responsive to the needs of groups and more productive at the level of societies.
+ The aim is not to build better tools for governing; ==it is to build tools that let people govern themselves.==
+ This is both practical and psychological, for in order to have healthy communities, we first need healthy individuals.
+ Importantly, this is not about pulling down fences - something anarchists are often accused of wanting to do. **Don't fight the system. Just abandon it** is a more apt slogan. 

### Rough consensus
+ Anarchy does not mean the tyranny of structurelessness. To us, it means...
	+ ==sovereign individuals== collaborating of their own volition on projects they choose to undertake
	+ ==emergent forms of organization== that need not be permanent, because they're not premised on personal power, but rather arise as a response to the needs of a group in a particular moment.
+ The best example of this kind of internet age governance is, unsurprisingly, the [IETF](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/consensus):
> We reject: kings, presidents and voting.
> We believe in: rough consensus and running code.

### Alegality
+ Alegal systems are those that =="can't care" about the human context== of the information they process
+  Think back to [what is valuable](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/#consensus) - the legal fiction of the firm (i.e. that it has a kind of personhood) allowed for orders of magnitude improvement in our organizational efficiency as a species.
+  Alegal fictions are the next evolution. 
	+ For the first time in history, we need not revolt against a ==system of violent legal enforcement. ==
	+ We can abandon it for ==openly verifiable mathematics==, which we subscribe to by acts of our own volition.

> ðŸ’¡ This is because, in the world wide web, running code is more powerful than holding elections.

+ In exactly the same way that we obviate the need to trust protocols by defining and encoding what it means to cheat; we can build systems that obviate the need to govern communities by ==encoding the means for individual sovereignty. ==
+ This is what it really means to explore new kinds of interpersonal trust enabled by trustless protocols: ==if we give everyone the ability to govern themselves, do we trust ourselves to be responsible?== Lao Tzu did, and so do we.
### Further references
*To follow the way yourself is real power.
To follow it in the family is abundant power.
To follow it in the community is steady power.
To follow it in the whole country is lasting power.
To follow it in the world is universal power.*

*So in myself I see what self is,
in my household I see what family is,
in my town I see what community is
in my nation I see what a country is,
in the world I see what is under heaven.*

*How do I know the world is so?
By this.*

## Radicality
### Liberally radical
+ In order to frame these kinds of [shared stories](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation/), we need to ask [better questions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/better-questions/) that go the heart of our [intentions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/intention/) and stem from **honesty** about, and [humility](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/humility/) arising from, our limits as human beings. 
+ This [inner orientation](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/purpose/), combined with technologies that encourage interpersonal trust between sovereign individuals, can be used to create emergent, responsive, communal structures better suited to coping with the [complexity](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/engineering/) of the [modern world](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/time/) than our current institutions.

### Optimal Gathering
+ We need to use modern mathematical tools to model **optimal collective decision making. **
+ The best means put forward so far is the mechanism of [Liberal Radicalism](https://gitcoin.co/blog/experiments-with-liberal-radicalism/), whose goal is "to create a funding system that is as flexible and responsive as the market, but avoids free-rider problems".
+ It's not enough to build tools that let people govern themselves, we have to craft the ==incentive structures which encourage the majority to behave in everyone's better interests. ==
	+ This is how healthy communities actually emerge: ==sovereign tools which encourage collaboration without compulsion. ==
	+ Malicious behaviour is just provably more expensive than its effects.
+ If individuals contribute to the public goods they use **and** the funding principle underlying the market is nonlinear, then we can make sure that "==small contributions are heavily subsidized== (as these are the most likely to be distorted by free-riding incentives) while ==large ones are least subsidized==, as these are more likely private goods."
