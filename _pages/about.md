# About Me
Hi, I'm Bianca Aguilar! I'm a designer, educator, and dancer who *really* loves to learn.
When I'm not taking notes here, I'm probably brain dumping in my [Are.na](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar).
Check out my [portfolio](https://bianca.digital) and my [writing](https://cathexis.substack.com)!

# About this Garden
This garden is powered by Obsidian, and brought to life through Jekyll and Netlify.
