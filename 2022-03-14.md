### An Overview of Discourse
**Questions:**
- What enables us to think about and in the process, tell these stories?
- Why and how can we tell stories in a way that is compelling and engaging at the same time?

**Notes:**
- Ratsinsky (2011) argued that the idea of discourse has become increasingly popular; has been used many times without being explicitly defined
- Discourse in narrative studies is the way a story is told or presented to its audience
- Includes:
	- how much time is dedicated to a particular scene
	- The amount of dialogue that is allotted to a particular character
	- The choice of actors to play characters
- Basically: The expression/telling of a story
- Questions:
	- Is it possible to have an exciting plot, but a lousy discourse? 
	- Or possble to have a lousy plot or engaging narrative discourse?

**TL;DR:**
- It's the ==way a story is told or presented== to the audience. 
-  If narrative structure is the WHAT, narrative discourse is the ==HOW.==

### Order, Duration, & Frequency
**Notes:**
- Order
	- the organization of the presents, and how it's presented to us
	- significant bc of how the events may be pieced together by the audience
	- important to the overall story and/or theme/topic!
- Duration
	- often tied with frequency
		- both elements place emphasis on events
		- they tell us about a particular point/episode in a character's life?
	- E.G. THE 24 show uses real-time narration (each episode takes place in a span of 24 hours)
- Frequency
- The way the story is told affects us in certain ways

**Summary:**
- **Order:** the ==method== by which a narrator chooses to ==organize and present events== that comprise the story or are relevant to it.
- **Duration:** ==how much time== scenes are dwelt on, lengthened, shortened, and even cut off completely
- **Frequency:** the ==number of times== a specific event recurs throughout a narrative.

### From the View of Post-Structuralism
> Literary Theorist Tzvetan Todorov, whom you encountered on a spiritual level previously, uses the term **DISCOURSE** to mean, _“the expression, the means by which events are communicated.”_

- This view however somehow limits the richness that narratives contain within them. 
- Therefore, to broaden our perspective, we will look at narrative discourse in light of post-structuralism as well. 

**Notes:**
- Post-structuralism is an attempt to focus on some of the overlooked possibilities/implications/etc. of structuralism
- Post-structuralism complements structuralism by offering an alternate mode of inquiry/explanation/interpretation
- Structuralism believes that meaning exists in fixed & stable patterns
	- Since language exists in patterns, certain underlying elements are very much common to all human experiences
	- Structuralists believe that we can observe these experiences through the patterns we have in society
	- Structuralism examines the elements of human culture against larger culture because of their belief that the patterns in those cultures underlie everything humans do
- Post-structuralism questions this assumption
	- According to them, the meaning of any text is indeterminate
	- Language, which is responsible for meaning-making, is full of contradictions
- Closely related to ideology
	- Structuralists ideologically believe that the world can be neatly arranged in categories of binary oppositions (and/or logic; e.g. man & woman, black & white)
	- For post-structuralists, these binary oppositions are insufficient to describe the complex underdigging of the world
	- These oppositions are loaded in terms of power structures, hierarchy...therefore we must examine them, not just accept them
	- Not universal knowledge at all
- E.G. IP loss
	- our lives have become so capitalistic, involving science
	- the benefits of science are being kept from those who need it the most
- in order to control the world, you have to know how to control discourse

**Summary:**
- From a post-structural view, discourse becomes preoccupied with ==uncovering the ways we end up talking about things—giving meaning to things—over a period of time.==
- Discourse no longer pertains to the construction of narrative, but rather, to the== deconstruction of categories==—like race, class, gender, or even history, politics, law, and many others.
-  So much of what we know is a ==product of organizations and institutions around us==

#### Discussion

> 1. What topics would you like to change the discourse of in the field of science and engineering? What changes would you like to bring forward with regard to this topic?
> 
> 2. What are the non-existent discourses in the area of science and engineering? What are we not talking enough about? What ideas would you like to introduce to the limited/non-existent conversations in this field?

**Outline:**
Mix of questions 1 & 2
1. I would love to change The Web3 space... cryptocurrency, NFTs, blockchain, etc. 
2. beneficial use cases: Digital Public goods

	2. link to take the green pill
	3. solarpunk future baby (link CCS): https://society.mirror.xyz/OuxuYixNEYVX6D0kW6aHMy9g66lEwf5KsnlIha7F0bQ
4. However...DEI needs to talked about more :'))
	1. A lot of issues...E.G. rampant racism, sexism, transphobia

		2. https://twitter.com/shardulgo/status/1501378259052732425
	2. Not beginner-friendly at all! Requires a lot of technical literacy....


**Writing:**

A topic I'd love to change the discourse of in STEM is Web3. This refers to the newest iteration of the World Wide Web; based on blockchain technology, it includes innovations like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Like many of my friends, I used to be a skeptic; based on what I saw I assumed that these technologies were wasteful and that only the rich and privileged could benefit from them. However, after exploring this space on my own (by [joining fellowships](https://kernel.community) and contributing to communities), I realized Web3's potential in building a better world. I believe that

Web3...solar punk future


- Solarpunk future
	-  building an optimistic future *together*; one that’s regenerative and focuses on humans thriving *alongside* each other and the world around us rather than in opposition to it.
	- It emphasizes a deep integration between, rather than separation of, technology and the environment as well as convivial conservation, self-sustainability, and social inclusiveness even for those without means. 
	- what it might look like for a community of users to self-govern the resource it creates in a more communal, reciprocal fashion.
- Public goods definition w/ examples (and counter-examples)
	- tragedy of the commons....
	- The regenerative economic tools being built in web3, including [“dweb” tech](https://getdweb.net/principles/), are one promising solution to these global coordination problems.
	- plug zine https://issuu.com/biancamikaila/docs/aguilar_finalproject
- Examples of how web3 can help us reach a solarpunk future:
	- Digital signatures and online identities by ENS
	- Retroactive public goods funding
	- Quadratic funding by Gitcoin


- However....we need more DEI
- Issues:
	- male-dominated; sexism
	- homophobia and transphobia....ick E.G. ENS
- Avoid doomerism! It's important to be critical, but we should also recognize the agency we have to take back control
- This is why I want to participate in this space as a neurodivergent POC woman
