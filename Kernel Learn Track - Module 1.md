## Ethereum's History and State
>  [Bitcoin] represents an incredibly important moment in the movement towards money as a protocol, the development of new means to create or describe value, and new media by which we can relate that to and with one another in an agreeable fashion. However, it is not the whole story: only its beginning. ==Genesis is a wonderful book, but the real work of setting people free occurs elsewhere.==

> So, this week, we'll begin trying to understand what happens when you combine a ==peer-to-peer architecture for the internet of money - and its immense intrinsic utility - with a Turing-complete programming language.== That is, we'll begin studying **Ethereum**.

## Meaning
> "When the truncheon may be used
in lieu of conversation,
words retain their power.
Words offer the means to meaning and,
for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth."
**V for Vendetta**

+ The fight for liberty is not conducted with natural language in the form of political rhetoric: it is **hashed out in technical protocols.** ==What matters most is not what you say, but what function(s) you can get your language to execute.==
+ **Cryptography** is so powerful, it is considered to be a ==munition== by many governments. 
	+ This is because it ==executes speech freely==, without the need for legal or political protection, and therefore outside the realm of legal or political control.

### The Means
+ Profound shift in meaning-making
	+ Caused by **widely-deployed cryptography** used to ==secure our ability to speak freely about what we find to be valuable==, without the need to trust corruptible institutions.
+ The functions our language executes produce deterministic outputs which are globally agreed upon.
+ **Vitalik  in Understanding Ethereum:** ==contracts (code)== and ==externally owned accounts (people)== are both first class citizens on Ethereum

> “It’s doubtful that programs will develop the desire to connect for the sake of it (like we do), unless we program them to do it. However, ==the benefits of knowing that a computation was verifiably done is like inventing religion for programs== [...] with verifiable computing protocols, a program will know the minds of other programs. Except, unlike biology, where it is imperfect, it will know exactly the state and processing capability. There’s no longer this idea of servers of data and logic connected disparately through the network.” - Simon de la Rouviere

### The Heart of It
+ The [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron) is the third of the [five solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid) postulated by Plato to make up all the elements - earth, water, fire, air and aether. 
+ The octahedron is the middle solid, and therefore associated in more modern metaphysics with the ==heart; love; compassion; forgiveness; and healing.== It has 8 faces, similar in a sense to the [Noble Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path). As is the case with all Platonic solids, it is symmetric and so its reflection remains the same.
+ ==**Such shapes remind us that we are all just mirrors for each other.**==
+ More practically, [space frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_frame) are a commonly used architectural design, extended into [octagonal trusses by Buckminster Fuller](https://tinyurl.com/mister-fuller) in his work on geodesic domes. Fuller is often quoted in crypto circles, with this being the go-to choice for many of his intellectual descendants:
> “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. ==To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.==”

## Value
+ What is value? Based on complementary opposites, we can ask **"What destroys value?"**
	+ Some suggestions include: disagreement, fear, deception, violence, anger, envy, and inefficiency.
	+ In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not.
+ If it is not disagreement, fear, deception and envy, then it seems like **trust in clearly shared truths** lies at the core of ==how we might generate valuable interactions between people.==

### Consensus
+ So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: **through fiction.**
	+ People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really ==just the lie which reveals truth.==
	+ What matters most in terms of true value generation is the ==efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction.==
+ The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our **ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions.**
	+ It has also ended up being extractive and corrupt, because legal text must be parsed and interpreted by humans, who are error-prone and easy to manipulate; and because legal text is - in fact - enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state.
+ **Blockchains implement a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction. **
	+ The core question remains: ==how many people can reliably share in the truth your fiction reveals, for this defines the constraints of what kinds of value can be generated with it.==

### Narrative
#society #sociology 
+ The development of human narratives
	+ Tribal narratives allowed truth to be shared between ~150 people. 
	+ These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. 
	+ It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. 
	+ Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: ==it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols.==
+ **Our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records.**
	+ However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in [trust](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust), the record was maintained *by someone*, which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them.
+ ==There is a whole new "trust space" we can explore==, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.
	+ Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths
	+ and **because the record itself is shared** across all participants, 
+ Question: As opposed to the legal fiction of the firm, what is the fiction that reveals the truth underlying the value generated by blockchains?
	+ Mathematical consensus (extra points if you said "cryptographically secure").
