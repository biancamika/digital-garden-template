## Outlines
### Draft 1
How can I bring in the idea of an infinite game...

1. **How internet native youth learn outside of schools**
	1. How do existing institutions — schools — fail them?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
		2. Most learning is the result of teaching
	2. How do alternatives such as communities (especially those found in games) serve them?
		1. Creation
			1. Creative, exploratory learning is problem-centered
		2. Collaboration
2. **How current systems exploit or underserve these youth**
	1. Games
		1. Creators dont get to profit from their work, only platforms
		2. IRL Inequality is elevated, as seen with virtual goods
	2. Same can be seen in education
3. **Why and how we would benefit from a web3 powered future**
	1. Thesis: in a web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game 
		1. An educational metaverse as the ultimate digital creative tool: "Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as co-creators with human beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.""
	2. Talk about why the youth is primed for this transition
		1. Used to virtual economies
			1. E.G. play-to-earn; in worlds like Club Penguin, kids (who were free members) were used to working more time for less pay
	3. List what should be required and avoided in order to create this future
		1. Core characteristics of public goods
			1. Non-rivalrous
				1. Open to everyone
			2. Non-excludable
				1. Decentralized
		2. Other characteristics:
			2. Incentives should be aligned for the good of all students
				1. Gamification, not pointsification
	4. Challenges to overcome
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Other challenges (social, economic...)
			1. Personal privacy
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	5. Speculative narrative of this metaverse with examples
		1. Thanks to wallets, everyone has a profile and inventory
			1. used as resume; used as passport
			2. Different skillsets = different classes a la D&D
		2. Richly populated educational environments; virtual immersive classes where people learn by doing
			1. Complete quests/bounties, get rewarded
			2. E.G. "students learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them."" 
		3. Teachers are levelled  up; they're now virtual architects, game designers, etc....
		4. Community-driven culture
			1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up
			2. 	Free/open-source syllabi
				1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded
				2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works

### Draft 2

1. **How digital natives learn outside of schools**
	1. Introduction
		1. "You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun." - Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*
		2. Talk about own personal story 
			1. As a kid, I had fun in the Internet through games and art communities -> all about creation
			2. E.G. creating graphics, roleplaying -> creating stories
			3. Transition to present time, where I'm benefitting from skills I gained through fun exploration, not structured education (i.e. art and design)
		3. Now, I see kids around me growing the same way... (cite examples)
			1. future developers learning programming through games like Roblox + Minecraft
			2. future artists practicing drawing + marketing through fandom communities in Twitter, Tumblr, Discord, etc.
		4. These [Present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years)
		5. So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the #1 venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces can make up for this — especially those powered by web3.
	4. How do schools fail students?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
		2. Most learning is the result of teaching
	5. How do alternatives such as communities (especially those found in games) serve them?
2. However, current systems still exploit or underserve these youth, just like in education
3. **Finite -> infinite games**
	1. Recap: I believe that the youth learn best in games (after all, we humans are Homo Ludens — born players). But I don't necessarily mean indicate video games. I'm talking about something more abstract: the games we play in life. 
	2. According to James Carse, there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. 
	3. Thanks to society, most of us are playing finite games
		1. Players have to parade around their wealth and status
		2. Examples
			1. URL
				1.  reaching the top of leaderboards
				2.  getting reach: X followers, X likes, X shares, etc...
			2. IRL 
				1. scoring the highest salary
				2. founding the next top startup  
		3. This has been encouraged by our existing educational environments
			1. Schools
			2. Even online platforms
	4. It's time for us to approach life as an infinite game
		1. The pursuit of excellence is a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers.
		2. Examples (according to [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games))
			1. Evolution, life, mind, and the technium (accumulation of inventions that humans have created)
			2. The things in life we love most -- including life itself -- are infinite games.
		3. Instead of playing within boundaries, players play with the boundaries.
			1. May Li Khoe: instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/) 
		4. Creation + collaboration > quantification + competition
		5. I believe that Web3 is the key to this shift
4. **Why and how we could benefit from a Web3 powered future**
