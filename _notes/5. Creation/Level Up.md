## Outline
How can I bring in the idea of an infinite game...

1. **How internet native youth learn outside of schools**
	1. How do existing institutions — schools — fail them?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
		2. Most learning is the result of teaching
	2. How do alternatives such as communities (especially those found in games) serve them?
		1. Creation
		2. Collaboration
2. **How current systems exploit or underserve these youth**
	1. Games
		1. Creators dont get to profit from their work, only platforms
		2. IRL Inequality is elevated, as seen with virtual goods
	2. Same can be seen in education
3. **Why and how we would benefit from a web3 powered future**
	1. Thesis: in a web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game 
		1. An educational metaverse as the ultimate digital creative tool: "Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as co-creators with human beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.""
	2. Talk about why the youth is primed for this transition
		1. Used to virtual economies
			1. E.G. play-to-earn; in worlds like Club Penguin, kids (who were free members) were used to working more time for less pay
	3. List what should be required and avoided in order to create this future
		1. Core characteristics of public goods
			1. Non-rivalrous
				1. Open to everyone
			2. Non-excludable
				1. Decentralized
		2. Other characteristics:
			2. Incentives should be aligned for the good of all students
				1. Gamification, not pointsification
	4. Challenges to overcome
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Other challenges (social, economic...)
			1. Personal privacy
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	5. Speculative narrative of this metaverse with examples
		1. Thanks to wallets, everyone has a profile and inventory
			1. used as resume; used as passport
			2. Different skillsets = different classes a la D&D
		2. Richly populated educational environments; virtual immersive classes where people learn by doing
			1. Complete quests/bounties, get rewarded
			2. E.G. "students learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them."" 
		3. Teachers are levelled  up; they're now virtual architects, game designers, etc....
		4. Community-driven culture
			1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up
			2. 	Free/open-source syllabi
				1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded
				2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works
