## Outlines
### Draft 1
How can I bring in the idea of an infinite game...

1. **How internet native youth learn outside of schools**
	1. How do existing institutions — schools — fail them?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
		2. Most learning is the result of teaching
	2. How do alternatives such as communities (especially those found in games) serve them?
		1. Creation
			1. Creative, exploratory learning is problem-centered
		2. Collaboration
2. **How current systems exploit or underserve these youth**
	1. Games
		1. Creators dont get to profit from their work, only platforms
		2. IRL Inequality is elevated, as seen with virtual goods
	2. Same can be seen in education
3. **Why and how we would benefit from a web3 powered future**
	1. Thesis: in a web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game 
		1. An educational metaverse as the ultimate digital creative tool: "Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as co-creators with human beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.""
	2. Talk about why the youth is primed for this transition
		1. Used to virtual economies
			1. E.G. play-to-earn; in worlds like Club Penguin, kids (who were free members) were used to working more time for less pay
	3. List what should be required and avoided in order to create this future
		1. Core characteristics of public goods
			1. Non-rivalrous
				1. Open to everyone
			2. Non-excludable
				1. Decentralized
		2. Other characteristics:
			2. Incentives should be aligned for the good of all students
				1. Gamification, not pointsification
	4. Challenges to overcome
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Other challenges (social, economic...)
			1. Personal privacy
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	5. Speculative narrative of this metaverse with examples
		1. Thanks to wallets, everyone has a profile and inventory
			1. used as resume; used as passport
			2. Different skillsets = different classes a la D&D
		2. Richly populated educational environments; virtual immersive classes where people learn by doing
			1. Complete quests/bounties, get rewarded
			2. E.G. "students learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them."" 
		3. Teachers are levelled  up; they're now virtual architects, game designers, etc....
		4. Community-driven culture
			1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up
			2. 	Free/open-source syllabi
				1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded
				2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works

### Draft 2

1. **How digital natives learn outside of schools**
	1. Introduction
		1. "You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun." - Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*
		2. Talk about own personal story 
			1. As a kid, I had fun in the Internet through games and art communities -> all about creation
			2. E.G. creating graphics, roleplaying -> creating stories
			3. Transition to present time, where I'm benefitting from skills I gained through fun exploration, not structured education (i.e. art and design)
		3. Now, I see kids around me growing the same way... (cite examples)
			1. future developers learning programming through games like Roblox + Minecraft
			2. future artists practicing drawing + marketing through fandom communities in Twitter, Tumblr, Discord, etc.
		4. These [Present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years)
		5. So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the #1 venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces can make up for this — especially those powered by web3.
	4. How do schools fail students?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
			1. Definitions
				1. Learning = acquiring new skill/insight 
				2. Promotion = social role assignment, depends on others' opinions
				3. Instruction = choice of circumstances that facilitate learning
			2. With school, role assignment is linked to instruction, not learning
				1. Done through a curriculum of conditions a student must meet (i.e grades)
				2. Not reasonable: doesn't link relevant competencies to roles, but instead the process by which these are acquired
				3. Not liberating: those who benefit the most from instruction are those who fit social norms (e.g. affulent, neurotypical)
			3. Even alternative education models (e.g. bootcamps, accelerators) have the same faults
				1. need to complete specified criteria in order to "graduate"
				2. certification/brand as main value prop
		2. Assuming that most learning is the result of teaching
			1. Most of the time, people acquire their knowledge not from what's intentionally taught in school, but what they casually encounter outside it
				1. Learning happens as a by-product of some other activity (e.g. reading fluency comes from frequently reading for pleasure)
			2. Thus, the way people learn in schools isn't optimally designed for them
				1. Centralization/standardization
					1. the scale of a school is inversely correlated with its curriculum quality, especially creative support
				2. Not rewarding failure (best way to learn)
					1. students aren't able to grow as much due to lack of feedback
					2. afraid to explore
				3. Punitive assessments
				4. Rewarding rote work
				5. Atomizing subjects
					1. we learn about topics in silos, when in real life everything is integrated with each other
	5. How do alternatives such as virtual communities (especially those found in video games) serve them?
		1. Gives students an environment + tools where they can make discoveries themselves. 
			1. Choose your own adventure: students can choose what they learn and how they learn it, instead of having to deal with the standardized way of learning things
			2. Provide space, time, and autonomy that schools do not
		2. Simulate reality + provide fast feedback loops
			1. more context = deeper understanding
			2. feedback mainly provided through real-time + async discussions with other members
			3. outputs/outcomes are tangible, directly related to the skills you learn 
				1. E.G. github repos to code, pieces to art, etc
			4. digital data (e.g. social media metrics) can also help w/ feedback
2. However, current systems still exploit or underserve these youth, just like in education
	1. Creators don't get to profit from their work, only platforms
		1. E.G. developers on Roblox find it hard to earn due to friction claiming profits + huge pay cut; creatives on social media are at the mercy of the algorithm
	2. IRL inequality is elevated thanks to digital divide
		1. those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much
		2. The premium experience reserved for those who can afford it; free members don't get these benefits unless they work for it
					1. E.G. memberships, virtual goods
	3. how can we tackle these problems?  let's get abstract
3. **Finite -> infinite games**
	1. Recap: I believe that the youth learn best in games (after all, we humans are Homo Ludens — born players). But I don't necessarily just mean video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. 
	2. According to James Carse, there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. 
	3. Thanks to society, most of us are playing finite games
		1. Players have to parade around their wealth and status
		2. Examples
			1. URL
				1.  reaching the top of leaderboards
				2.  getting reach: X followers, X likes, X shares, etc...
			2. IRL 
				1. scoring the highest salary
				2. founding the next top startup  
		3. This has been encouraged by our existing educational environments
			1. Schools
			2. Even online platforms
	4. It's time for us to approach life as an infinite game
		1. The pursuit of excellence is a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers.
		2. Examples (according to [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games))
			1. Evolution, life, mind, and the technium (accumulation of inventions that humans have created)
			2. The things in life we love most -- including life itself -- are infinite games.
		3. Instead of playing within boundaries, players play with the boundaries.
			1. May Li Khoe: instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/) 
		4. Creation + collaboration > quantification + competition
			1. the online spaces I was a part of encouraged these values
		5. I believe that Web3 is the key to this shift
4. **Why and how we could benefit from a Web3 powered future**
	1. In a Web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game. What does this even mean? Or look like?
		1. What does web3-powered mean?
			1. [In web3, interactions in application/software are done through wallets](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133)
			2. In web3, users reclaim ownership of the internet due to decentralization
				1. Web2: "Our consumption is driven by black-box algorithmic feeds, our work and property are only ours to borrow, and our value creation has been severely discredited. We don't own any of our digital properties, and we've been wired to accept it."
				2. Web3: now we can have control over...
					1. our work + property -> NFTs
					2. platforms we participate in ->  protocols, and the way they structure incentives
		2. Web3 is helping build the foundation of the Metaverse
			1. What is the Metaverse? "the next iteration of the Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection."
			2. Already being done in Web2 through social [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) E.G. platforms like Gather and games like Roblox and Fornite
		3. How is education connected with this?
			1.  We're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms
				1.  People learn through encounters they have through systems that may exist for non-educational purposes 
				2.  E.G. Communities centered around products, teaching others how to make the most out of it through shared resources, discussions, etc -> Figma, Notion
				3.  Thus, learning feels more natural
			2.  The Metaverse provides the perfect educational environment by...
				1.  immersive; simulates reality
					1.  instead of reading about a topic, you experience it for yourself
				2.  brings together people wth diverse ideas and interests, without the barriers of physical location
		4. Educational metaverse as ultimate digital creative tool
	2. How can we create this future?
		1. Education must be a public good
			1. Non-rivalrous
			2. Non-excludable
		2. Other characteristics
	3. What challenges must be overcome?
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Misc. challenges (i.e. social, economic)
			1. Personal privacy
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	4. What does living this future looks like? (speculative)
