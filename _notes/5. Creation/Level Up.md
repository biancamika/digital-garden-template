## Outlines
### Draft 1
How can I bring in the idea of an infinite game...

1. **How internet native youth learn outside of schools**
	1. How do existing institutions — schools — fail them?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
		2. Most learning is the result of teaching
	2. How do alternatives such as communities (especially those found in games) serve them?
		1. Creation
			1. Creative, exploratory learning is problem-centered
		2. Collaboration
2. **How current systems exploit or underserve these youth**
	1. Games
		1. Creators dont get to profit from their work, only platforms
		2. IRL Inequality is elevated, as seen with virtual goods
	2. Same can be seen in education
3. **Why and how we would benefit from a web3 powered future**
	1. Thesis: in a web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game 
		1. An educational metaverse as the ultimate digital creative tool: "Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as co-creators with human beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.""
	2. Talk about why the youth is primed for this transition
		1. Used to virtual economies
			1. E.G. play-to-earn; in worlds like Club Penguin, kids (who were free members) were used to working more time for less pay
	3. List what should be required and avoided in order to create this future
		1. Core characteristics of public goods
			1. Non-rivalrous
				1. Open to everyone
			2. Non-excludable
				1. Decentralized
		2. Other characteristics:
			2. Incentives should be aligned for the good of all students
				1. Gamification, not pointsification
	4. Challenges to overcome
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Other challenges (social, economic...)
			1. Personal privacy
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	5. Speculative narrative of this metaverse with examples
		1. Thanks to wallets, everyone has a profile and inventory
			1. used as resume; used as passport
			2. Different skillsets = different classes a la D&D
		2. Richly populated educational environments; virtual immersive classes where people learn by doing
			1. Complete quests/bounties, get rewarded
			2. E.G. "students learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them."" 
		3. Teachers are levelled  up; they're now virtual architects, game designers, etc....
		4. Community-driven culture
			1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up
			2. 	Free/open-source syllabi
				1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded
				2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works

### Draft 2

1. **How digital natives learn outside of schools**
	1. Introduction
		1. "You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun." - Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*
		2. Talk about own personal story 
			1. As a kid, I had fun in the Internet through games and art communities -> all about creation
			2. E.G. creating graphics, roleplaying -> creating stories
			3. Transition to present time, where I'm benefitting from skills I gained through fun exploration, not structured education (i.e. art and design)
		3. Now, I see kids around me growing the same way... (cite examples)
			1. future developers learning programming through games like Roblox + Minecraft
			2. future artists practicing drawing + marketing through fandom communities in Twitter, Tumblr, Discord, etc.
		4. These [Present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years)
		5. So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the #1 venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces can make up for this — especially those powered by web3.
	4. How do schools fail students?
		1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment
			1. Definitions
				1. Learning = acquiring new skill/insight 
				2. Promotion = social role assignment, depends on others' opinions
				3. Instruction = choice of circumstances that facilitate learning
			2. With school, role assignment is linked to instruction, not learning
				1. Done through a curriculum of conditions a student must meet (i.e grades)
				2. Not reasonable: doesn't link relevant competencies to roles, but instead the process by which these are acquired
				3. Not liberating: those who benefit the most from instruction are those who fit social norms (e.g. affulent, neurotypical)
			3. Even alternative education models (e.g. bootcamps, accelerators) have the same faults
				1. need to complete specified criteria in order to "graduate"
				2. certification/brand as main value prop
		2. Assuming that most learning is the result of teaching
			1. Most of the time, people acquire their knowledge not from what's intentionally taught in school, but what they casually encounter outside it
				1. Learning happens as a by-product of some other activity (e.g. reading fluency comes from frequently reading for pleasure)
			2. Thus, the way people learn in schools isn't optimally designed for them
				1. Centralization/standardization
					1. the scale of a school is inversely correlated with its curriculum quality, especially creative support
				2. Not rewarding failure (best way to learn)
					1. students aren't able to grow as much due to lack of feedback
					2. afraid to explore
				3. Punitive assessments
				4. Rewarding rote work
				5. Atomizing subjects
					1. we learn about topics in silos, when in real life everything is integrated with each other
	5. How do alternatives such as virtual communities (especially those found in video games) serve them?
		1. Gives students an environment + tools where they can make discoveries themselves. 
			1. Choose your own adventure: students can choose what they learn and how they learn it, instead of having to deal with the standardized way of learning things
			2. Provide space, time, and autonomy that schools do not
		2. Simulate reality + provide fast feedback loops
			1. more context = deeper understanding
			2. feedback mainly provided through real-time + async discussions with other members
			3. outputs/outcomes are tangible, directly related to the skills you learn 
				1. E.G. github repos to code, pieces to art, etc
			4. digital data (e.g. social media metrics) can also help w/ feedback
2. However, current systems still exploit or underserve these youth, just like in education
	1. Creators don't get to profit from their work, only platforms
		1. E.G. developers on Roblox find it hard to earn due to friction claiming profits + huge pay cut; creatives on social media are at the mercy of the algorithm
	2. IRL inequality is elevated thanks to digital divide
		1. those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much
		2. The premium experience reserved for those who can afford it; free members don't get these benefits unless they work for it
					1. E.G. memberships, virtual goods
	3. how can we tackle these problems?  let's get abstract
3. **Finite -> infinite games**
	1. Recap: I believe that the youth learn best in games (after all, we humans are Homo Ludens — born players). But I don't necessarily just mean video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. 
	2. According to James Carse, there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. 
	3. Thanks to society, most of us are playing finite games
		1. Players have to parade around their wealth and status
		2. Examples
			1. URL
				1.  reaching the top of leaderboards
				2.  getting reach: X followers, X likes, X shares, etc...
			2. IRL 
				1. scoring the highest salary
				2. founding the next top startup  
		3. This has been encouraged by our existing educational environments
			1. Schools
			2. Even online platforms
	4. It's time for us to approach life as an infinite game
		1. The pursuit of excellence is a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers.
		2. Examples (according to [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games))
			1. Evolution, life, mind, and the technium (accumulation of inventions that humans have created)
			2. The things in life we love most -- including life itself -- are infinite games.
		3. Instead of playing within boundaries, players play with the boundaries.
			1. May Li Khoe: instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/) 
		4. Creation + collaboration > quantification + competition
			1. the online spaces I was a part of encouraged these values
		5. I believe that Web3 is the key to this shift
4. **Why and how we could benefit from a Web3 powered future**
	1. In a Web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game. What does this even mean? Or look like?
		1. What does web3-powered mean?
			1. [In web3, interactions in application/software are done through wallets](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133)
			2. In web3, users reclaim ownership of the internet due to decentralization
				1. Web2: "Our consumption is driven by black-box algorithmic feeds, our work and property are only ours to borrow, and our value creation has been severely discredited. We don't own any of our digital properties, and we've been wired to accept it."
				2. Web3: now we can have control over...
					1. our work + property -> NFTs
					2. platforms we participate in ->  protocols, and the way they structure incentives
		2. Web3 is helping build the foundation of the Metaverse
			1. What is the Metaverse? "the next iteration of the Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection."
			2. Already being done in Web2 through social [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) E.G. platforms like Gather and games like Roblox and Fornite
		3. How is education connected with this?
			1.  We're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms
				1.  People learn through encounters they have through systems that may exist for non-educational purposes 
				2.  E.G. Communities centered around products, teaching others how to make the most out of it through shared resources, discussions, etc -> Figma, Notion
				3.  Thus, learning feels more natural
			2.  The Metaverse provides the perfect educational environment by...
				1.  immersive; simulates reality
					1.  shortened feedback loops from theory to practice: instead of reading about a topic, you experience it for yourself
				2.  brings together people wth diverse ideas and interests, without the barriers of physical location
					1.  more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information
		4. An educational metaverse would be the ultimate digital creative tool (according to [[Computers and Creativity - Thesis]])
			1. To foster optimal human innovation, digital creative tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven.
				1. Interopability: the ability for different computers to connect and exchange information
					1. people's works are no longer confined to singular platforms/tools
					2. this allows for more collaboration and innovation
				2. Moldability: the ability for the user to tailor their software to better address the problem they are trying to solve
					1. customizability enables creativity
				3. Efficiency
					1. [The metaverse is infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/)
					2. Makes real-time communication, managing presence, earning money, etc. easier
				4. Community-driven
					1. the people within in the metaverse is what brings it to life (i.e. content generation, community building)
			2. These tools hold potential as co-creators with human-beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.
				1. "If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it."
	2. The youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems. [How?](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1459176570174672897)
		1. (Value) Creation/Contribution
			1. used to working for status/rewards
				1. E.G. levelling up by grinding through quests, or by commenting enough (Top Fan) 
			2. native to virtual currencies -> tokens & wallets
			3. used to virtual goods -> NFTs
			4.  willing to put up with learning curve just to have fun
			5.  constant remixing & modding -> composability
				1. not just seen in game mods, but in social media e.g. Dribbble remixes, Tiktok duets
		2. Community
			1.  power-users of guilds/forums/Discord -> DAOs
			2.  vocal + passionate user base -> community-led governance
				1.  E.G. moderators of forums
		3. Culture 
			1. internet identities -> anonymity/psuedonymity/reputation
			2. internet memes + language -> web3 memes + language
	3. How can we create this future?
		1. This educational metaverse must be a public good
			1. Non-rivalrous: accessible to everybody; one person's use of the good does not impact its availability to others
				1. intensive learning experiences like fellowships and bootcamps are inherently rivalrous, since more people = less quality interaction
			2. Non-excludable: it should be impossible to exclude anybody from using the good
				1. 	Cost of money, time, literacy, etc. can exclude others
		2. Creating this metaverse needs game design (integrated), not gamification (just added-on)
			1. Gamification is often pointsification, which is all about external motivation
				1.  E.G. points, badges, leaderboards; a.k.a. a finite game
				2.  this isn't sustainable; doesn't work for building actual skills long-term
			2.  Games are their best when they're played out of genuine interest; same should apply for participants of this metaverse. There must be:
				1.  A goal/specific outcome that provides players with a sense of purpose
				2.  Rules that place limitations on how players can achieve the goal
				3.  A feedback system that tells players how close they are to achieving their goal
				4.  Voluntary participation
	4. What other challenges must be overcome?
		1. Technological challenges
			1. Internet infrastructure
			2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time
			3. Language barriers
			4. Latency issues
		2. Misc. challenges (i.e. social, economic)
			1. Personal privacy
				1. Do we really want to make everything we learn visible on the blockchain?
			2. Marketplace competition
			3. Misinformation
	5. What does living this future looks like? (speculative)
		1. Told through the perspective of a  teacher onboarding students into this metaverse
			1. Vibes: The Magic School Bus? Hhahahaha
			2. This teacher doesn't have a traditional background; even if they weren't professionally licensed as a teacher, their IRL experience + skills made them qualified
		2. They get started with creating their identity. Thanks to wallets, they have their own profile and inventory
			1. This is a dynamic resume: everything you learn is shown on-chain
			2. This is a passport to web3 applications; whether it's through consumption, curation, publication, or investing, it'll show your online travels
		3. How to build identity: students are able to explore by completing quests/bounties that interest them, and getting rewarded 
		4. The teacher transports them to an introductory quest (that they designed themselves), an immersive environment where they do a Giant [Tower Building Challenge](https://www.wickedproblemsolver.com/blog-2/blog-post-title-two-tk47y), where they have to build the tallest freestanding structure
		5. This experience introduces them to collaboration, and how the metaverse is driven by community-driven culture
			1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up in this game
			2. Free/open-source syllabi
				1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded
				2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works
					1. Info overload + quality control is a problem...curators are elevated, can also become teachers
		6. All students get a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for completing onboarding!
		7. Ends on a hopeful note? Maybe the teacher saying how they're excited to see their students' journeys of lifelong learning? ahhaha

## Writing
> "You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun." — Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*

As a kid who grew up on the Internet, creating was a way of living.  I remember spending hours telling stories online, whether it be through drawing fanart or roleplaying fantasies. It got to the point when my mother enforced a limit, worried that I was getting addicted to the computer. Now, I've found myself being gifted various opportunities (e.g. a prestigious scholarship, international freelance gigs, exciting Web3 projects) thanks to being well-versed in design, art, and writing: these are skills that I primarily gained not through sitting in school, but through having fun online.

Around me, I see kids growing up the same way. At one end, there are developers learning programming through creation games like Roblox and Minecraft. At another, there are artists cultivating their craft in fandom communities on Twitter and Discord. I believe that these kids aren't just making their own futures, but the world's as well; investor Chris Dixon says that these [present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years). Today's youth will be tomorrow's innovators.

So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the main venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces make up for this.


### Schools, spaces, and how students do in them

First, our educational institutions are designed to benefit the system, not the student.  They are influenced by what sociologist George Ritzer calls ["McDonaldization"](https://www.cpp.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/McDonaldization.htm), where principles of the fast food industry, driven by “rationality,” dominate other sectors of society. It is expressed through four characteristics: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Efficiency is seen in grouping students by age and replacing teachers with online lessons. Calculability is seen in ridiculous class sizes and high stakes testing. Predictability is seen in standardized curriculums and overreliance on lecture slides. Control is seen in automatic grading and using fear as incentive. 

To summarize, here's a statement from [educator Shelley Wright](https://shelleywright.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/the-mcdonaldization-of-education-the-rise-of-slow/): "McDonaldization attempts to wipe out any of the messiness or inefficiencies of learning. Instead, it attempts to reduce it to a commodity that can be packaged, marketed and sold. Rather than cultivating a deep, holistic love of learning that touches every aspect of a student’s life, learning has been reduced to an assembly line. In reality, we’ve imposed a mechanistic view of life onto how people learn, which is largely an organic process, and at a great cost."

So how do virtual spaces — like video games and online communities — serve them? In ["Video Games are the Future of Education"](https://nabeelqu.co/education), Nabeel Qureshi gives multiple conclusions. 

One, they give students the environment and tools to make discoveries themselves. This is because they provide space, time, and autonomy, which enables students to *choose* what they learn and how they learn it. Schools cannot provide this level of freedom. That's why kids remember what they encounter through engaging in these spaces, and forget what is taught to them in classes. They need to feel like it's just *play*.

Two, these spaces provide deep understanding of subjects. This is because they simulate reality and provide fast feedback loops, thanks to innovative features like immersive  environments and real-time communication. Outputs are tangible to students, and directly related to the skills they learn (e.g. Git repositories to code, published pieces to art); this applies to the response their works get as well (e.g. comments, metrics). Compare this to the typical school experience, which is quite shallow; when you're focused on memorizing information just to pass exams, you don't have the capacity to dive deep into a topic.

In short, virtual spaces are optimal learning environments because they provide additional context and creative freedom. Aside from this, they bring together people with diverse ideas and interests since there are no barriers of physical location. This allows for a more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information. All of this is empowering for students. However, these spaces are still capable of exploiting or underserving the youth, just like in traditional education. 

One, real life inequality is elevated due to the digital divide. Those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much as people who can. Even worse, these spaces can also bar people financially. [In many MMO games, the premium experience (i.e. exclusive items, more user privileges) is reserved for those who can afford a membership](https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds?r=8kghs&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=). Free members can't get these unless they work for it (a.k.a. putting in more time for less pay). 

Two, most creators don't get to benefit from their work, since majority of profit goes to the platforms. For example: [it is challenging for game developers to make money on Roblox, and the platform profits from people trying](https://www.wired.com/story/on-roblox-kids-learn-its-hard-to-earn-money-making-games/).  Developers only get a 25 percent cut of revenue, which is one third of the industry standard. If they want to take out their earnings, they must have a premium subscription ($5 a month) and earn a minimum of 100,000 Robux. This disincentivizes them from withdrawing. 

Overall, these conditions make it difficult for youth to get value not just from these spaces, but from the work they produce in them. It's why many parents/guardians aren't accepting of their kids' spending so much time online; they see it as a waste of time and money, and are unable to see how it could be beneficial long-term. Imagine how much creators would be enabled if these barriers to participation were removed.  How can we tackle these problems? It's time to get abstract.

### Changing the game
To recap: I believe that the youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are [Homo Ludens](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/233221.Homo_Ludens) — born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life.

According to [James Carse](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games), there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. In our current society, most of us are playing finite games. Online, people aim for getting to the top of the leaderboards, or increasing reach: X amount of followers, likes, shares, etc. Offline, people desire to score the highest salary, or acquiring that prestigious degree.  Our existing educational environments encourage this way of thinking: not just schools, but also the online platforms we occupy (e.g. social media). This zero-sum mentality is not healthy to have long-term, especially for creators. No matter what or how much you make, it would never be enough. It's a recipe for burnout. 

What if we approached life as an infinite game? Success doesn't have to be stressful; in fact, [the pursuit of excellence can be a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers](https://www.weareworldquant.com/en/thought-leadership/playing-the-infinite-game/). According to writer [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games), evolution, life, the mind, and the technium (the accumulation of all inventions that humans have ever created) are infinite games. The things in life we love most can be played the same way. How to start: instead of playing within boundaries, play with them. Technologist May-Li Khoe advises: "...instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/)."

What attracted me to MMO games and art communities were the values they encouraged: creation and collaboration. All people wanted to do was to keep making things and sharing them with others.  This wholesome culture changed with the [advent of platforms](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-rise-fall-internet-art-communities); now, interactions are quantifiable and people are motivated by competition. If we want to make learning feel like play, we need to revive the culture of the early web, so that creation feels like an infinite game once again. And I believe that the key to this shift lies in a whole new web: Web3. 

### Powered by Web3
In a Web3-powered future, learning is an (infinite) game. ==Expand on this==

But first, what is Web3, and what does it even mean to be powered by it? To understand this, we must first learn about Web1 and Web2. 

Web1 is all about consumption. Since the web was still in its early stages of development, most Internet users were readers of static web pages. It was difficult to produce your own web pages since it required both technical literacy and available time. Creativity was still alive though; because of technical constraints, [everything was *handmade*](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), from website navigation to image placement. No two home pages looked the same. 

This changed with the arrival of Web2, which is all about creation. The invention of platforms (i.e. blogging and social media) made it easier to create content; now, anyone can be both consumer and creator. However, it can be argued that some creative power was sacrificed. One, individuality declined. Due to efficiency, users were working *inside* systems instead of *building* their own. Two, content is owned by companies operating platforms, not the users who generated all of it. This is the price they pay for using these platforms, along with their personal data. 

Thankfully, Web3 is all about ownership. It's a new version of the Internet where [interactions in applications/software are facilitated through wallets — which serve as both verified identities and funding sources](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133).  This decentralizes the web, empowering users to own their content, data, and assets. For instance, the content a creator produces would not be limited to a single platform. They'd be able to directly profit from their work too, thanks to NFTs. Compare this to Web2, where creators don't fully own their work and are forced to act based on their platforms' black-box algorithms. Overall, the power of Web3 gives users the freedom that is essential to an infinite game of learning. 

Web3 is also helping build the foundation of the Metaverse: an Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection. We are already seeing this in [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) such as games like Fortnite and platforms like Gather. How is this tied to learning? We're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. This means that people learn through encounters they have in systems that may exist for non-educational purposes. For example, see communities centered around SaaS products like Figma and Notion; people teach others how to make the most out of products through shared resources and instructive tutorials. As the ultimate virtual space, the Metaverse is the perfect environment for embedding education. 

### We're ready for this future

### How can we create it?
