[Fast Food Education: Calling For A More Natural Approach To Teaching & Learning In America](https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Education-Approach-Teaching/dp/1606580000)  Review:

> Fast food was created in order to satisfy people cheaply and efficiently throughout the world. It is ==tasty, cheap==, and everybody loves the taste, even if it is ==unhealthy==. This concept of fast food has spread to schools throughout the country. Dr. P Mark Taylor and Darris J. Brock discuss this theory in their book Fast Food Education. They define education as “what is left over when you forget everything that your teacher made you memorize when you were in school.” (41) This book discusses the flaws in today’s education system and how it can be altered to benefit more students. I agree with this book’s beliefs on education and the authors present the information with an interesting and gripping metaphor. 
> 
> The authors believe that ==education is poorly scaled.== Students are put into grades based on age and not on readiness to proceed to the next grade level. The authors thought to “imagine that a major auto manufacturer had decided that they would move an auto to the next stage of the assembly line as long as the work was at least 65% complete.” (25) Just like with cars, students will not succeed without fully completing a stage in the “assembly line”. When students partially understand the material, they pass the test, and then forget everything they just learned. Taylor and Brock believe that ==a student should completely understand the material before they are allowed to proceed to the following grade.== Teachers complain that students constantly stay they did not learn that from last year, when they did. They just forget it once the test is over. ==If education was scaled based on readiness, then students would absorb and comprehend all the information before moving onto the next grade. ==
> 
> Because the schools are not putting in the effort to teach children like they should be, children are not putting in the effort as well. ==Fast food is made quickly and the same for everybody. That is what is happening with education. No matter what learning technique a student needs, everybody learns the same way.== This way of teaching leads students to solely do work to earn a good grade. No one wants to absorb new information just to gain more knowledge anymore. Students are given the material to memorize then they take a test. Once they pass the test, the curriculum exits the brain. Now, some teachers cram the lessons into their students’ brains so the kids will pass and they will not get fired or in trouble for being a poor teacher because all his/her kid’s passed. In order to curve teacher’s from viewing education like this, Taylor and Brock believe in ==natural education which is when “we learn by experiencing, failing, working hard to make adjustments, experiencing success, and honing our skills.”== (46) This is a better method of teaching than having students memorize random facts they cannot connect to the world with. ==Education today needs to allow the students to problem solve in situations they will actually come across, not when train A leaves the station from Oregon and train B leaves the station from Boston, etc.== These authors believe that natural education will greatly benefit the future generations. 
> 
> Similarly to the flaws that Taylor and Brock see in education, the documentary Waiting for Superman discusses these issues. Families are taking their children out of public schools so they can have a better education. In public schools, the kids were being taught through memorization and based off the teacher’s desire to not fail, when it should be based off the teacher’s desire to inspire children. The families in the documentary feel that their children are not getting the education that they need and deserve. If Taylor and Brock’s idea of natural education was implemented in schools then maybe these families would not feel the need to pull their students out of public school. 
> 
> I believe that no one should have to pull their children out of public school because they do not think that their child is getting a good education. This book does a good job expressing the beliefs of the authors without being a boring book lecturing on about the problems with education. Taylor and Brock make the book relatable and thought-provoking through their real-life metaphors. Normally, I am not a fan of fiction books unless it is on a topic I am truly passionate about, but this book is the exception. 

[With Success In Fast Food And Fast Fashion, Is It Time For Fast Education?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61)
> The ==digital revolution== and ==affordable internet access== arrived in the 1990s and made almost any B2C industry (always fragmented) fast. 

> As life speeds up, ==not everyone can afford to learn that long==, so we have a trend toward faster education.

> ==Global digitalization== pushed many educational programs online, and these courses tend to become shorter.

> Fast education means ==shorter lessons==. Bite-sized learning is one of the key educational trends of the 21st century that brings comfort. You study at your own pace whenever and wherever you want. Educational courses can be divided into smaller parts so that you don’t need more than 15 minutes a day to study.

> You can study ==for free==, which is often time-consuming, using, for example, university courses on popular educational platforms. Alternatively, you may need to spend some time on YouTube before finding the quality trainer or course that suits you best. Or you can opt for specialized course providers that will improve your skills for a relatively small fee. 

> Fast education will mean ==fast changes== and ==quick adaptation== of the latest trends. 

[Global survey reveals growing interest in shorter programmes and lifelong learning](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/)
> As for what is prompting the shift in approach among learners, John Fallon, CEO of Pearson, says that “the ==new talent economy== has arrived with its gig jobs, unconventional career paths and tech disruption.”

> Deloitte defines the talent economy, a relatively new term, as a ==“collaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business … where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before.”==

> The quickly changing needs of today’s developed economies means that students and professionals must adjust to new trends regularly and this is prompting growing interest in ==lifelong learning – and learning that is often undertaken piece by piece.== These pieces may be degrees or smaller, more specialised credentials that may be more affordable and may also come from different institutions and from online platforms. The result is that students are considering a much wider range of programmes, institutions, and delivery models than they ever have, and this is the opportunity Pearson is identifying.

Could perhaps also apply to emerging economies like the PH?
> The Pearson study found that an understanding of the need for lifelong learning is much more established in China and India than in the US and UK, ==“driven in large part by the influence of technology and automation on their jobs.”== These are countries where keeping up with – or better yet staying a step ahead of – technological trends is crucial to getting and keeping steady employment.

> As for which way they could imagine ==upskilling==, the largest proportions said they would do it through “a short training programme such as a boot-camp, certificate programme, or something offered by a professional association.” 

[THE THIRD EDUCATION REVOLUTION
](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/)

> Now a ==third wave in education and training== has arrived, argue economists, educators, and workforce-development officials. The level of preparation that worked in the first two waves—adding more time to education early in life—does not seem sufficient in the 21st-century economy. Instead the third wave is likely to be ==marked by continual training throughout a person’s lifetime—to keep current in a career, to learn how to complement rising levels of automation, and to gain skills for new work.== Workers will likely consume this lifelong learning in short spurts when they need it, rather than in lengthy blocks of time as they do now when it often takes months or years to complete certificates and degrees.

[[Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]
> One big worry, however, is that the arrival of lifelong education will only ==exacerbate the economic divide== that already exists in the United States. Education levels in the U.S. are closely tied to income. Simply put: Rich kids are far more likely to graduate from college than are their poor and working-class peers. There’s no reason not to believe that trend won’t continue in this third wave of lifelong learning. It is likely to help workers who already have high levels of education get the training they need rather than assist underemployed or unemployed workers who need to upskill to keep a job or get a new one.

> Two simultaneous forces in the job market are driving this push toward lifelong learning. The first is ==automation== and the ==widening divide between the lifetime earnings of high-school and college graduates.==

> The second is the ==emergence of the gig economy==, which is reshaping the traditional employer-employee relationship as more contractors and freelancers fill roles once reserved for full-time workers making good salaries. While the term “the gig economy” conjures up images of popular apps for temporary work, such as Uber and Task Rabbit, the army of professional white-collar freelancers is larger than that encompassing the services we can request on our smartphones. In a 2016 study, two economists, Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger, found that all net employment growth in the United States since 2005 appears to have come from what they termed “alternative work”—that is, contract and freelance work, which has ballooned by more than 50 percent over the last decade.

[[Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]
> Rather than focus on routine skills that can be replaced by technology, job training needs to target ==key skills that complement technology, such as problem solving, teamwork, and communication.==

> If training and education become a lifelong pursuit, the big question is ==how to pay for it.==

> “While we don’t know what skills will be required for the human-centric jobs of the future such as health care, management consultants, and financial planners,” said Alssid, who has spent more than two decades in the workforce-development field, “we do know that these jobs will require a ==highly adaptable workforce that can think critically, creatively, and work collaboratively to find solutions to rapidly developing, complex problems.==”

> Such skills, often referred to as “soft skills,” are typically seen in liberal-arts graduates, but those individuals often lack the technical skills employers want. Alssid said ==a hybrid of liberal-arts and technical education is what is most needed in training programs to allow workers to better navigate the ambiguity of the future job market.== That’s the goal of his school’s partnership with Infosys—to introduce liberal-arts students to technical fields that they might not have previously considered, while other programs will introduce the flexibility of the liberal arts to technical workers.
## Pitch (200 words?)

Ed-tech experiments

Fast food education can be empowering or exploitative

Fast food education upholds the status quo.
Factory like, producing workers and not thinkers
Global South

Apprenticeships, bootcamps, MOOCs, and more: all of these alternative education options are  part of the trend I call "Fast Food Education". Now that it's rising in the Global South, I want to explore its potential to both empower and exploit students.

### What is fast food education?
Fast food education is another term for vocational education programmes that are prominent in the edtech industry. They're known for their short timeframe, accessible costs, and up-to-date curriculum -- promising you a career that liberal education couldn't guarantee. For this essay, I'll be focusing on two types of fast food education: compressed courses like MooCs and micro-credentials, and skills-based intensives such as bootcamps and cohort-based courses.

#### Rise in popularity
These programmes are part of what Selingo calls the [third education revolution](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/): continual training throughout a person's lifetime. This has been brought about by the following forces: technological developments, the wage gap between college graduates and those with "lesser education", and the talent economy. 

First, technology has always served as the backbone of innovation. For instance, [fragmented B2C industries became fast thanks to the internet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61) -- it made buying anything a few clicks away. Now, the same is happening to education; lessons are no longer taught in classrooms, but in videos and Zooms. This shift to remote learning has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since education is more accessible, there's no excuse not to be learning.

Another technological driver of the third education revolution is automation. The wage gap between college graduates and those with "lesser education" continues to widen because of the fear that their jobs could end up automated. This worry isn't baseless; according to a [McKinsey report](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/), this could happen to at least one-third of activities in about 60 percent of occupations by 2030. So to avoid losing their jobs, people have no choice but to upskill.

Finally, there's the emergence of the [talent economy](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), which Deloitte defines as a “collaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business … where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before". This no longer includes just app-enabled gig workers, but also professional white-collar freelancers. Since today's economies have quickly changing needs, people need to adjust to new trends -- leading them to constant retraining.

The third education revolution is more pronounced in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia. According to a [Parthenon-EY paper](http://cdn.ey.com/parthenon/pdf/perspectives/Parthenon-EY_SE-Asia_Paper_final_092016_singles.pdf), economic growth, demographic trends, and cultural shifts have prompted regional demand for higher education. However, [Lau](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/south-east-asia-higher-educations-next-global-hotspot) reports that socio-economic barriers such as a global recession, outdated infrastructure, and political instability  have made higher education an inaccessible/undesirable option. Automation also has a huge influence; in fact, [many Southeast Asians](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/maintenance) participate in [ghost work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_work): the invisible human labor that powers the products and services of Silicon Valley. Thus, keeping up with technogical trends is integral to getting and staying employed.

Overall, technological and economic developments have pushed people to pursue lifelong learning, but traditional institutions are unable to respond to the high demand due to expensive costs, long timeframes, and slow adaptation. In a [global Pearson study](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), less than six in ten respondents felt that their country's education system worked well for the current generation; more than four in ten respondents (in affulent countries like Australia, Canada, and the US) believed that higher education did not prepare them for their career. Now is a perfect time for disruption, which is why fast food education is currently thriving. 

### Empowerment or exploitation?
There's no denying the benefits of fast food education.

However, 
Transition to cons

#### Questionable quality

#### Equity  problems

#### Cultural homogenization



### Call-to-action
