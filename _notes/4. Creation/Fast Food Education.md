## Notes
[Are MOOCs, Bootcamps and Other Alternative Education Options Effective?](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2017-07-21/are-moocs-bootcamps-and-other-alternative-education-options-effective)
> Brown and Kurzweil evaluated five types of programs: ==certificate programs==, which offer labor market-focused training; ==work-based training==, like apprenticeships; ==skills-based short courses==, like coding bootcamps; ==Massive Open Online Courses and online micro-credentials==; and ==competency-based education programs==, which offer credentials based on skill acquisition rather than traditional course completion.

> education is ==not a product but a process==, one that happens (or not) inside of those being educated.

> Also worth noting: that of those surveyed by Course Report, 60% already had bachelor’s degrees. Arguably, this makes the ==bootcamp certification more of an addition to the college degree than a substitute for one.==

[The Lower Ed Ecosystem: Bootcamps Edition](https://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/the-lower-ed-ecosystem-bootcamps-edition/)
> Coding bootcamps are the new MOOCs which were the new correspondence school which was the old video on-demand schools.

> Boot camps are a ==tax paid== by winners of social inequality for ==marginally better odds== in hyperlocal short term occupational bubbles

> Boot camps are a tax paid by suitably credentialed workers who do ==not have enough capital== (economic, social, or cultural) to ==enter a high status field of work== in which some job is undergoing an actual or projected short-term demand bubble.

> Lower Ed did not refer to a set of schools but to a ==sociological process of credentialism.== Bootcamps are part of the Lower Ed ecosystem

[Fast Food Education: Calling For A More Natural Approach To Teaching & Learning In America](https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Education-Approach-Teaching/dp/1606580000)  Review:

> Fast food was created in order to satisfy people cheaply and efficiently throughout the world. It is ==tasty, cheap==, and everybody loves the taste, even if it is ==unhealthy==. This concept of fast food has spread to schools throughout the country. Dr. P Mark Taylor and Darris J. Brock discuss this theory in their book Fast Food Education. They define education as “what is left over when you forget everything that your teacher made you memorize when you were in school.” (41) This book discusses the flaws in today’s education system and how it can be altered to benefit more students. I agree with this book’s beliefs on education and the authors present the information with an interesting and gripping metaphor. 
> 
> The authors believe that ==education is poorly scaled.== Students are put into grades based on age and not on readiness to proceed to the next grade level. The authors thought to “imagine that a major auto manufacturer had decided that they would move an auto to the next stage of the assembly line as long as the work was at least 65% complete.” (25) Just like with cars, students will not succeed without fully completing a stage in the “assembly line”. When students partially understand the material, they pass the test, and then forget everything they just learned. Taylor and Brock believe that ==a student should completely understand the material before they are allowed to proceed to the following grade.== Teachers complain that students constantly stay they did not learn that from last year, when they did. They just forget it once the test is over. ==If education was scaled based on readiness, then students would absorb and comprehend all the information before moving onto the next grade. ==
> 
> Because the schools are not putting in the effort to teach children like they should be, children are not putting in the effort as well. ==Fast food is made quickly and the same for everybody. That is what is happening with education. No matter what learning technique a student needs, everybody learns the same way.== This way of teaching leads students to solely do work to earn a good grade. No one wants to absorb new information just to gain more knowledge anymore. Students are given the material to memorize then they take a test. Once they pass the test, the curriculum exits the brain. Now, some teachers cram the lessons into their students’ brains so the kids will pass and they will not get fired or in trouble for being a poor teacher because all his/her kid’s passed. In order to curve teacher’s from viewing education like this, Taylor and Brock believe in ==natural education which is when “we learn by experiencing, failing, working hard to make adjustments, experiencing success, and honing our skills.”== (46) This is a better method of teaching than having students memorize random facts they cannot connect to the world with. ==Education today needs to allow the students to problem solve in situations they will actually come across, not when train A leaves the station from Oregon and train B leaves the station from Boston, etc.== These authors believe that natural education will greatly benefit the future generations. 
> 
> Similarly to the flaws that Taylor and Brock see in education, the documentary Waiting for Superman discusses these issues. Families are taking their children out of public schools so they can have a better education. In public schools, the kids were being taught through memorization and based off the teacher’s desire to not fail, when it should be based off the teacher’s desire to inspire children. The families in the documentary feel that their children are not getting the education that they need and deserve. If Taylor and Brock’s idea of natural education was implemented in schools then maybe these families would not feel the need to pull their students out of public school. 
> 
> I believe that no one should have to pull their children out of public school because they do not think that their child is getting a good education. This book does a good job expressing the beliefs of the authors without being a boring book lecturing on about the problems with education. Taylor and Brock make the book relatable and thought-provoking through their real-life metaphors. Normally, I am not a fan of fiction books unless it is on a topic I am truly passionate about, but this book is the exception. 



## Pitch (200 words?)

Ed-tech experiments

Fast food education can be empowering or exploitative

Fast food education upholds the status quo.
Factory like, producing workers and not thinkers
Global South

Apprenticeships, bootcamps, MOOCs, and more: all of these alternative education options are  part of the trend I call "Fast Food Education". Now that it's rising in the Global South, I want to explore its potential to both empower and exploit students.
