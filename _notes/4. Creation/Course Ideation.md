## Hyperlink form
### What's the course about?
*In a few words, e.g. "Language construction workshop" or "How to build an online community"*
Dissecting Digital Design

### What do you imagine the structure looks like?
*In a few short paragraphs: what are the main learning goals? How long is it and how frequently does it meet? What's the workload? Initial thoughts on what the list of sessions could look like?*

This course will be making use of the foundational disciplines of digital design that bootcamps tend to mix: disciplines like anthropology, philosophy, art history, etc (according to https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/). By the end of this course, the student will be a critical thinker, now equipped with the base knowledge to thoughtfully design for others.

I envision this to take at most 6 weeks; meetings will be weekly, taking up at least 90 minutes. The curriculum starts at the micro level, examing details of software (e.g. visuals), then ends at the macro level by examining systems embedded in technology (e.g. digital public spaces).
### Who do you imagine is the ideal participant?
*Who should take this course? Who should not take it?*
 

### How much do you imagine it will cost?
*In USD. rough estimate fine for now; we can discuss further! Our pricing model: you set a price, Hyperlink takes a 20% platform fee, you keep 80%.*
50 USD
### What might the artifacts or output of the course look like?
*What are the participants making or doing in the course? Any assignments or final projects in mind?*

Here are some lesson + activity ideas:
+ A bit of art history covering skeumorphism, icons etc., basically how to make abstract concepts understandable; visual communication
+ Lesson thinking of platforms like cities  (e.g. New_Public)
+ Lesson on colonization (Westernization) of design; activity is designing an app to be "not boring" (inspired by Andy Works LLC)
+ Lesson on motion design; not just usual interactions and gestures but also how these necessarily enable play (see https://situated.blog/2021/02/design-for-fidgeting)
+ Lesson on ethics and dark patterns; activity would be designing a terms of service that people would actually read
### Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your overall vision for the course?
*How does this fit with your work? Why are you the right person to teach it? How much time do you imagine spending on it? Any long-term ideas for how it might develop?*

Hi! I'm Bianca, a designer, educator, and writer. When I'm not working, I'm engaged with young tech communities like Developh and Reboot. I want to cultivate the next generation of technologists and creatives as thinkers, not just makers.

To be honest, I'm currently jaded with design at the moment. Most design resources and communities either focus on cultivating craft or career. This is what I've witnessed being involved in several local tech communities + interning at a UX bootcamp. That's great and all, but I can't help thinking...is that all? With this level of education, you're guaranteed to get a product design job at a company. Surely there's more to design than just that...I want to take part in envisioning new futures, not just building the present. But how can I do that when I've been trained as a maker? Hence my desire to nurture critical thinking.

At the moment, it's hard to find a go-to resource for  design/technology x critical thinking. Most of what I've found are courses from elite institutions (e.g. RISD) that make use of jargon that can be quite intimidating to beginners! My course would be the friendlier version of this. I hope this courses inspires the available online tech/design education (especially in my country) to aim to cultivate critical thinking.
