## Notes
[Are MOOCs, Bootcamps and Other Alternative Education Options Effective?](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2017-07-21/are-moocs-bootcamps-and-other-alternative-education-options-effective)
> Brown and Kurzweil evaluated five types of programs: certificate programs, which offer labor market-focused training; work-based training, like apprenticeships; skills-based short courses, like coding bootcamps; Massive Open Online Courses and online micro-credentials; and competency-based education programs, which offer credentials based on skill acquisition rather than traditional course completion.


## Pitch (200 words?)

Ed-tech experiments

Fast food education can be empowering or exploitative

Fast food education upholds the status quo.
Factory like, producing workers and not thinkers
Global South

Apprenticeships, bootcamps, MOOCs, and more: all of these alternative education options are  part of the trend I call "Fast Food Education". Now that it's rising in the Global South, I want to explore its potential to both empower and exploit students.
