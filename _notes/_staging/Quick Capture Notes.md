### Reboot Community Spotlight: Nikhil
**Framework:**
1. SENSING - info intake, active reading
2. REASONING - asking questions, applying knowledge, critical thinking
3. ACTING - learning by doing

You need to be situated, embodied, etc.

**Good pedagogy should help you:**
1. Give info
2. Help you think about it
3. Give opportunities to use it

**Content-format relationship matters**: in math you might read a book to learn theory, reasoning is thinking about it, then you apply it to a problem

**Links:**
+ Verasitium on educational content that prioritizes engagement
+ Tools for Thought Andy link
+ Andy's Why Books Don't Work

**What is your post-tech dream? What would you be doing if you had no material constraints? If you weren't worried about time? If there weren't any ethical obligations to do anything/if the world weren't burning?**
In my post-tech dream, I'd be an artist, creative technologist, and researcher dedicated to exploring my interests in movement, learning, and technology. Our devices have made us so disconnected from our bodies; I believe that encouraging embodiment through technology will be better for our wellbeing.

**Recommended books? What's the last book that changed your mind in a way that you care about?**
I can't recommend enough Ted Chiang's short story collections, like "Stories of Your Life and Others" and "Exhalation". Because of him, I fell in love with sci-fi and speculative fiction as a whole; reading these genres have made me a more thoughtful designer and human being.

### Tim Ferris 5 Bullet Friday
“Be crumbled,
so wildflowers will come up
where you are.
You have been stony for too many years.
Try something different.
==Surrender.==”

— Rumi
[This is a portion of a longer poem, as found in the first bullet, “In The Light Of Dying Stars.”]

> The problem is that our culture does not recognize that the ==true nature of math is art.== So we teach it in a manner that would just as easily ruin any other art. ... What if music education was all about notation and theory, with listening or playing only open to those who somehow persevered until college

### Brain Pickings
#### Willa Cather
> Cather had honed her own ==love of life — that essential wellspring of creative vitality== — in childhood

> Cather laments that nothing is more “fatal to the spirit of art” than the rise of what she aptly terms ==“superficial culture” ==— the commodification of art not as an instrument of aliveness but as a status symbol

> The creative experience, Cather insists, is a matter of tuning into the inner feeling-tone strummed not by our cerebrations but by our ==creaturely relishment of the world.==

> Many people seem to think that art is a luxury to be imported and tacked on to life. Art springs out of the very stuff that life is made of. Most of our young authors start to write a story and make a few observations from nature to add local color. The results are invariably false and hollow. ==Art must spring out of the fullness and the richness of life.==
