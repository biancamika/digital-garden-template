- <mark>What universities do a poor job of teaching is practical, applicable knowledge you can use on day 1 of your job. On the flip side, most (good) universities do a wonderful job of teaching complex CS topics that help hone problem-solving abilities and produce self-sufficient programmers.</mark>

- <mark>Also worth noting: that of those surveyed by Course Report, 60% already had bachelor’s degrees. Arguably, this makes the bootcamp certification more of an addition to the college degree than a substitute for one.</mark>

- <mark>Similarly, MOOCs — the massively open online courses that were popularized in the 2010s and continue in other modern forms today — offer evergreen, on-demand, recorded videos, often with a defined syllabus program. But their completion rate, as has been widely reported, is just 3 to 6 percent.</mark>

- <mark>On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that with proper rich education experience, people will be better equipped to cure social ills that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.</mark>

[Learning to earn vs. learning to learn - EdMuse](https://edmuse.substack.com/p/learning-to-earn-vs-learning-to-learn?cmdid=C5LDVGZUUBHWGR)
- <mark>This line of thinking falls into Snedden's view of education and society: people are either consumers or producers. In this model of education, education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty; the status quo is always upheld. When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.</mark>

Fast food education upholds status quo?

[Learning to earn vs. learning to learn - EdMuse](https://edmuse.substack.com/p/learning-to-earn-vs-learning-to-learn?cmdid=C5LDVGZUUBHWGR)
- <mark>In response to this, Dewey wrote 2 articles to address vocational education. Dewey argued that vocationalists like Snedden erred in two respects:; their vision of vocational education is too closely allied with the interests of industrialists to serve the greater public interest, and; it suggests an imprudent approach to educational reform, whereby no meaningful change is ever forthcoming. Vocationalism merely props up the status quo, a disappointing state of industrial relations warranting the continued exploitation of workers by management.</mark>

[Learning to earn vs. learning to learn - EdMuse](https://edmuse.substack.com/p/learning-to-earn-vs-learning-to-learn?cmdid=C5LDVGZUUBHWGR)
- <mark>As part of his vision for democratic education, Dewey believed that education should do more beyond training students to fill a job. He believed that learning should be deeply personal and students should learn a broad range of subjects to allow them to participate in greater democracy. This was in contrast to the administrative progressive who favored a more pragmatic view on educated: a vocational approach in order to train workers to fuel the economy.</mark>

Compare these perspectives?

- <mark>Teaching and learning is not a simple matter of rote knowledge transmission—experts passing information to non-experts by whatever medium is available. That conceit, what Brazilian educator and philosopher Paolo Freire called the “banking” model of education, conceives of students as identical, replaceable workers.</mark>

[The case study factory](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/?cmdid=HF70HUL49ZDKQ3)
- <mark>Because these bootcamps are by definition short programs, they tend to focus exclusively on the practical skills and methods that a UX designer needs to find their first job. This means that such courses tend to skip what might be considered the foundational disciplines of digital design, such as anthropology, philosophy, art history, and graphic design.</mark>

- <mark>“The curriculum itself is indistinguishable from any of the free resources available online,” he added. “It’s all very surface level. That’s to be expected if you’re targeting junior engineers, but at the same time, they go way too broad. It’s ridiculous that they spend two lectures about The Block Chain — with a student project — while skimming over basic iOS fundamentals.”</mark>

[Udacity’s Sebastian Thrun, Godfather Of Free Online Education, Changes](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb?cmdid=SFNSHD99DG5GWC)
- <mark>Learning, after all, is about more than some concrete set of vocational skills. It is about thinking critically and asking questions, about finding ways to see the world from different points of view rather than one’s own. These, I point out, are not skills easily acquired by YouTube video.</mark>

- <mark>“At the end of the day, the true value proposition of education is employment,” Thrun says, sounding more CEO than professor. “If you focus on the single question of who knows best what students need in the workforce, it’s the people already in the workforce. Why not give industry a voice?”</mark>

- <mark>the reality is that the vast majority of people who sign up for this type of class already have bachelor’s degrees, according to Andrew Kelly, the director of the Center on Higher Education Reform at the American Enterprise Institute. “The sort of simplistic suggestion that MOOCs are going to disrupt the entire education system is very premature,” he says.</mark>

- <mark>the shockingly low number of students who actually finish the classes, which is fewer than 10%. Not all of those people received a passing grade, either, meaning that for every 100 pupils who enrolled in a free course, something like five actually learned the topic. If this was an education revolution, it was a disturbingly uneven one.</mark>

- <mark>It will be, Thrun admits, “the biggest shift in the history of the company,” a pivot that involves charging money for classes and abandoning academic disciplines in favor of more vocational-focused learning. In short, Thrun must prove that Udacity is something more than a good story.</mark>
