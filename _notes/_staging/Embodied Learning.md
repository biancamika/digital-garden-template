The Superhuman Playbook: Embodied Learning with Erica Appelros
- Cognitive embodiment
- Mirror neutrons ^
- When we watch others perform such an action, the same networks activated when we perform the action are activated
- Sixth sense/proprioception
- Our whole being is made to work in combination w/ each other
- ^ which is why isolated learning is boring
- Rituals are how we can apply learning
- Paying attention is key 
- You experience the emotion if you perform the facial expression
- ^ helps with recall
- Study: washing hands and watching video of washing hands can lessen guilt
- Store them in your body (related: The Body is the Score)

Information Futurism
- Information futurism: where will we be going? When you step back and look at history, one of the most consistent trends is that you need info to build a good society
- Thinking in current paradigm v.s. Future paradigm
- Not going the optimal route (more steps vs less steps) gives you more information; more exploration

Embodied Learning
- How do we (builders) to talk about the ways people interact with information?
- How mind, body, and world work together
- People deliberately made more moves in tetris bc it gave them more information
- Two classes of action: pragmatic (changing the world for the purpose of changing the world) and epistemic (actions we take into the world to make mental computations simpler)
- People try to use their body in problem-solving; it’s not just looking
- Legacy idea: brain does all of the work
- Embodiment: we are making a huge mistake by ignoring the body and its role in interacting
- ^ happening in design world
- People doing synthesis work and applying it to irl is important
- Example of epistemic interaction: probing

World Teacher Podcast
- we are all born in tune with our bodies
- The body is the mediator of emotion
- Start with where the learner is
- Their goals > our goals


Exponential
- The body is intimately involved in all our though processes: understanding, emotions, and decision making

- <mark>Norman Triplett, who published what many consider one of the early experiments in social psychology, found that cyclists performed better when around others, concluding that even the “bodily presence of another contestant participating simultaneously in the race serves to liberate latent energy not ordinarily available.”</mark>

- <mark>the single most powerful approach to comprehension and retention is interactive processing, which occurs when “students engage in interaction with partners or teammates over the content.”</mark>
