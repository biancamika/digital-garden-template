## Notes
### Freedom
+ [[Freedom is being conscious of your constraints]].
+ Being defined through complementary opposites...this is what the Buddhists call "[[The freedom of no escape]]"
	+ Nowhere to go but here
	+ By accepting reality as it is, instead of how we wish it to be, we are liberated
	+ [[Freedom from conditioning]]
+ Current struggle isn't collective, but individual?
	+ Western individualism?
	+ There are still collective issues worth fighting for (e.g. basic needs, equal opportunity, just institutions)
	+ Graeber: "Forgive debt and redisribute the land"
	+ What is *also* required is "every soul taking every single step"
		+ Humanity pursuing perceptual knowledge 
		+ Recreating old community in new form
			+ Relevant: [[The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet - Literature Notes]]
+ Freedom is the combination of **awareness and acceptance**
	+ Embracing boundaries > denying them
	+ What makes real liberation a daily experience
	+ Instead of a concept only realized onced an external project comes to fruition
		+ relegating freedom to an idealized future...can't be found there
		+ we need to find it within ourselves 
		+ internal over external
+ Value is generated from **trust in clearly shared truths**
+ Trust in the modern world is an emergent property of protocols that **define + encode cheating**
	+ This prevents cheating without the need for human interpretation or enforcement
	+ E.G. Smart contracts? 
+ Freedom is **is our conscious ability to decide which shared truths to trust** based on how well defined and encoded the concept of "cheating" is
	+ "Cheating" is what creates those truths
		+ Definition through complementary oppposite
	+ We have the freedom to **define what boundaries we choose**
		+ We can't choose to operate without boundaries
		+ The *practice of freedom* includes accepting that we can't exist without limitations
+ Lived freedom is the **conscious navigation of responsibility**
	+ This reminds me of the free will debate
		+ Secular view: [Why You Probably Don't Have Free Will](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/free-will-illusion-sam-harris/)
		+ Religious view:
			+ [Free will in theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_in_theology#:~:text=man%20is%20endowed%20with%20freedom,human%20freedom%20and%20divine%20grace%22.&text=God%20has%20freely%20chosen%20to,the%20work%20of%20his%20grace.)
			+ [Argument from free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will)
	+ free to the extent you take responsibility for the consequences of your actions
+ As someone working in tech...
	+ the products I create shouldn't aim to make people "more free"
		+ false marketing campaigns and dissapointment
		+ automating stuff? probably comes with drawbacks
		+ [[Technology keeps us stuck in a feedback loop with ourselves]]
	+ instead, they should be conscious of, and communicate clearly, how they constrain the people who use them
		+ better Terms of Service? 
	+ this creates an environment for people to become aware of the trade-offs they're making -> only kind of freedom that can be trusted to generate sustainable value
	+ [[Technology must be used as a tool of liberation]]
