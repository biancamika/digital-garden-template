## Reboot Summary
[[Design justice]]
> Design justice also focuses on the ==design of systems==


> Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.

### Design Education

[[Education lives within a system of domination and liberation]]
> ==Education lives within a system of domination and liberation==; each participant should think, question, and act to identify the causes of the problems within that system.

### On Learning and Building
[[Constructionism]]
> quote about constructionism: “Learning is a ==reconstruction==, rather than a transmission of knowledge.”

> although it is beautiful to think about how nothing is truly done, learnt or built alone, ==we must always consider who and what we are (re)constructing with. ==

> If learning is a reconstruction of knowledge, then ==everything we learn reflects the learnings of the people we’re told to listen to== unless we choose to do otherwise.

> By seeking out diverse voices and learning together, we can build ==shared consciousness== and better understand the world and the predicaments that plague us.

## Book
### Chapter 5
> “Critical pedagogy seeks to transform consciousness, to provide students with ways of knowing that enable them to know themselves better and live in the world more fully.
—bell hooks, Teaching to Transgress”

[[Banking model of education]]
> “banking model of education, in which an educator, positioned as the expert, attempts to ==deposit knowledge== in the mind of their students.”
