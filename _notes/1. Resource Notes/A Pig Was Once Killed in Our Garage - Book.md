## Highlights
> “What I write here is not my teaching, but my study; it is not a lesson for others, but for me.” - Michel de Montaigne, “Of Practice”
### Of Lists
- The Infinity of Lists, Umberto Eco
- two ways to view the world: finite form and open-endedness of lists
- these are both central to the literary experience
> there is one which privileges the finite form, within which lies an entire cosmos; and there is another which performs an appreciation for what we harbor no illusion of being able to contain.
### 4.
> Here I was thinking that writing was about finding inherent orders, connecting plot points that naturally lead to agreeable insights. Didion, on the other hand, catalogued.
### 8.
> Prayer was supposed to be more a plea for vigilance, chants we collectively utter for strength, strength found in simply saying the same thing, perhaps meaning that we believed in the same thing and were thus not alone.

> Repetition, like prayer—the things we say to ourselves—is its own kind of healing. And what is healing but an insistence.

### Dao
> Home, I've learned, is where families accumulate things like objects, moments, and most especially, days.

### After Sagada
> "Whereas remembered images are the *residue* of continuous experience, a photograph isolates the appearances of a disconnected instant." - John Berger

> Consequently, photographs have meaning because we as viewers are "lending it a past and a future." It is an act of lending when we use words to make up for the ambiguity inherently present in all photographs when we as viewers are without access to information about context and orogonal content.
