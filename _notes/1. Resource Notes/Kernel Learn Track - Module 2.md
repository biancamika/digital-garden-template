## The Global Financial System
> We hope that you can already appreciate a little bit more deeply how to make meaning from the raw material of your life; not necessarily through grandiose action, but rather as the result of joyful little subversions along the way of real awareness and humility. ==A life lived wide awake naturally leads to various explorations of trust and value; the kinds of shared truth we preserve in narrative and pass between generations.== Now that we have ownerless, borderless protocols for recording such history, we can potentially multiply the effects of thousands of little individual subversions into a more stable, global joy.

> We'll begin with a short introduction to ==asking better questions==, because it really is worth asking about why systems are the way they currently are before moving straight into a disruptive mindset. From there, we'll take an extended journey - through the links between money and speech - into the very belly of the beast.

## Asking Better Questions
1. The most simple, seemingly silly questions are almost always the most profound.
2. Good questions must come from a sincere desire to learn, rather than as a veiled means of stating your own opinion.
3. Experts rarely ask good questions. Be a beginner, always.
4. Questions are an opportunity to be humbled. Asking good questions is indistinguishable from *practicing humility.*
5. Own up to what you don't know. It will set others free and you may end up coming closer to the shared truths which are a hallmark of honest conversation between peers.
6. Close listening and clear attention are **preconditions** for good questions.
7. A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world. Don't be afraid of letting others teach you; it does not degrade you, it uplifts you. The ego doesn't always acknowledge this simple truth.

+ Asking better questions is about process and **practice**
	+ Skill, not innate trait
+ Applies to KERNEL's thinking methodology
	+ being able to identify patterns of meaning through complementary opposites -> being able to ask better, simpler, and more direct questions
+ Honest conversations contain shared truths that create value
+ Starting point to ask yourself: "What goes this really *mean*?"
	+ About whether **you** can understand basic principles
		+ If you can't, it's either because:
			+ it's not a well-formed idea (then move on)
			+ or you need to learn a new skill in order to understand its implications
+ How do you develop a willingness to learn? It begins with clarity and honesty about what you don't know.
	+ This makes you more incentivized to improve yourself, because no one likes feeling inelt (even though we all are)
+ Experience the benefits of beginner's mind, not conceptually, but in the actual course of your life
	+ About starting now, trying for yourself, being frustrated by your lack of expertise, and letting your heart show your mind how to celebrate this fecund state of not-knowing - for therein lies ==both truth and liberation.==

### Questioning "Better" Questions
[Corey Petty](https://thebitcoinpodcast.com/) and Justin B question the claim made in point 3 above. The debate boils down to whether asking good questions in general is an ability best developed through disciplined exercise of rational skill, or the cultivation of "beginner's mind". In particular, techniques like [the Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) develop rational inquiry in order to fuel deeper, more intuitive understanding of a given topic. Corey writes:
> ==Experience and reflection, learning from our mistakes, and developing understanding all provide nuance.== A mechanic doesn't develop his ability to diagnose a problem solely from introspection. It is through the combination of knowledge and understanding that intuition arises. I've spent most of my life honing skills that give me broad and deep understanding for the *specific purpose* of being able to ask good questions in any context.

Or Justin B:

> I feel that ==knowledge of the specific==, e.g. computer science, translates directly into ==intuition around the general.==

The mechanic or scientist's skill does grow more nuanced through acquisition of knowledge and skill by the exercise of discipline, and this does lead to ==more specific questions about utility.== In this way, honing a skill leads to asking questions about that particular discipline, which is a good thing. So, let us add an 8th point:

**8. Asking good questions requires a deep appreciation of context.**

However, "beginner's mind" is not opposed to rational inquiry and the honing of skill: it is, in fact, the pinnacle of such discipline. Consider the Socratic method more closely:

> Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questions are open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. ==The technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.==

+ Rational inquiry demands a diagnosis; a solution; an end to a process which had its beginning in the mind. 
	+ What can such a mind do in the face of "no single right answer"? It can develop [negative capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability), but even this is insufficient, because ==we're not after skillful intellectual understanding: we seek harmonious and clear ways of living.== And life is not only rational.
+ Accepting honestly your own limitations and inability to understand everything that happens around you creates the space within for curiosity. 
	+ You can genuinely enjoy never knowing what's going to happen next, which leads to asking questions which come from the heart and go to the heart of the subject being questioned.
	+  It is, as Paul Myburgh says, ==perceptual rather than conceptual: simple knowledge of things-as-they-are.==
