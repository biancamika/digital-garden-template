## The Global Financial System
> We hope that you can already appreciate a little bit more deeply how to make meaning from the raw material of your life; not necessarily through grandiose action, but rather as the result of joyful little subversions along the way of real awareness and humility. ==A life lived wide awake naturally leads to various explorations of trust and value; the kinds of shared truth we preserve in narrative and pass between generations.== Now that we have ownerless, borderless protocols for recording such history, we can potentially multiply the effects of thousands of little individual subversions into a more stable, global joy.

> We'll begin with a short introduction to ==asking better questions==, because it really is worth asking about why systems are the way they currently are before moving straight into a disruptive mindset. From there, we'll take an extended journey - through the links between money and speech - into the very belly of the beast.

## Asking Better Questions
1. The most simple, seemingly silly questions are almost always the most profound.
2. Good questions must come from a sincere desire to learn, rather than as a veiled means of stating your own opinion.
3. Experts rarely ask good questions. Be a beginner, always.
4. Questions are an opportunity to be humbled. Asking good questions is indistinguishable from *practicing humility.*
5. Own up to what you don't know. It will set others free and you may end up coming closer to the shared truths which are a hallmark of honest conversation between peers.
6. Close listening and clear attention are **preconditions** for good questions.
7. A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world. Don't be afraid of letting others teach you; it does not degrade you, it uplifts you. The ego doesn't always acknowledge this simple truth.

+ Asking better questions is about process and **practice**
	+ Skill, not innate trait
+ Applies to KERNEL's thinking methodology
	+ being able to identify patterns of meaning through complementary opposites -> being able to ask better, simpler, and more direct questions
+ Honest conversations contain shared truths that create value
+ Starting point to ask yourself: "What goes this really *mean*?"
	+ About whether **you** can understand basic principles
		+ If you can't, it's either because:
			+ it's not a well-formed idea (then move on)
			+ or you need to learn a new skill in order to understand its implications
+ How do you develop a willingness to learn? It begins with clarity and honesty about what you don't know.
	+ This makes you more incentivized to improve yourself, because no one likes feeling inelt (even though we all are)
+ Experience the benefits of beginner's mind, not conceptually, but in the actual course of your life
	+ About starting now, trying for yourself, being frustrated by your lack of expertise, and letting your heart show your mind how to celebrate this fecund state of not-knowing - for therein lies ==both truth and liberation.==

### 68 Life Lessons
[68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice from Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

### Questioning "Better" Questions
[Corey Petty](https://thebitcoinpodcast.com/) and Justin B question the claim made in point 3 above. The debate boils down to whether asking good questions in general is an ability best developed through disciplined exercise of rational skill, or the cultivation of "beginner's mind". In particular, techniques like [the Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) develop rational inquiry in order to fuel deeper, more intuitive understanding of a given topic. Corey writes:
> ==Experience and reflection, learning from our mistakes, and developing understanding all provide nuance.== A mechanic doesn't develop his ability to diagnose a problem solely from introspection. It is through the combination of knowledge and understanding that intuition arises. I've spent most of my life honing skills that give me broad and deep understanding for the *specific purpose* of being able to ask good questions in any context.

Or Justin B:

> I feel that ==knowledge of the specific==, e.g. computer science, translates directly into ==intuition around the general.==

The mechanic or scientist's skill does grow more nuanced through acquisition of knowledge and skill by the exercise of discipline, and this does lead to ==more specific questions about utility.== In this way, honing a skill leads to asking questions about that particular discipline, which is a good thing. So, let us add an 8th point:

**8. Asking good questions requires a deep appreciation of context.**

However, "beginner's mind" is not opposed to rational inquiry and the honing of skill: it is, in fact, the pinnacle of such discipline. Consider the Socratic method more closely:

> Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questions are open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. ==The technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.==

+ Rational inquiry demands a diagnosis; a solution; an end to a process which had its beginning in the mind. 
	+ What can such a mind do in the face of "no single right answer"? It can develop [negative capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability), but even this is insufficient, because ==we're not after skillful intellectual understanding: we seek harmonious and clear ways of living.== And life is not only rational.
+ Accepting honestly your own limitations and inability to understand everything that happens around you creates the space within for curiosity. 
	+ You can genuinely enjoy never knowing what's going to happen next, which leads to asking questions which come from the heart and go to the heart of the subject being questioned.
	+  It is, as Paul Myburgh says, ==perceptual rather than conceptual: simple knowledge of things-as-they-are.==


## Money and speech
> "Put your money where your mouth is!"

A tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record is a new way of simultaneously ordering both which ==makes possible valuable==, ==meaningful communication== with anyone, anywhere in any way we care to program it. TL;DR: **a new kind of money and language.**

### Magic internet meaning

+ Our [narratives](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation) and [financial records](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/#narrative) were clearly distinct before 2009
	+ But share common language from twin practices of [faith and finance](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance)
+ Money as a programmable protocol that relies on a **shared record** no-one owns is a development of the *order* of language
	+ Collapses distinction between ==narratives around which we organize== and ==our record of societal debt==
+ Meaningful communication is a balance between the ==fact that your *ability* to speak ought to be free==, with the ==fact that you don't get to say whatever you please.==
	+ Freedom of speech enshrined as a constitutional good
	+ Implement error-handling for exceptions like hate speech and defamation
+ Your ability to [access the network](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value) (like TCP/IP) is free in all senses, ==requiring only a connection that can support you speaking in the same language as your peers. ==
	+ Protocols capable of processing valuable narratives (e.g. Bitcoin and Ehereum) render interperive balancing acts (negotiation, communication) unnecessary
	+ Saying anything *meaningful* (i.e. state-changing) has a specific, well-defined economic cost, captured in transaction fees which accrue to the benefit of those who "listen" to what you have to say.
+ The **primary benefit** of this new order of econo-linguistic network we now communicate with: 
	+ everyone is simultaneously free to speak 
	+ the cost of any kind of meaningful speech is well-defined everywhere. 
+ We are also provided with a clear definition of meaning: ==any speech act which changes the state of our shared record.==

### Regulation vs expense
+ In blockchains, speech and execution are *one and the same thing* and interpretation is deterministic.
+ Protocol has bare minimum of rules required for consensus
	+ You cannot double spend a token
	+ Every peer processes every transaction which passes these rules without fear or favor
+ The context is determined not by legal interpretation, but by **economics.**
	+ Enshrining an ideal like "free speech" which we agree is good -> certain behaviours we agree to be malicious are made prohibitively expensive
	+ They are not disallowed, just economically unsustainable, in much the same way that ==prevention is better than any cure.==
	+ Related: Vitalik's [Devcon 1](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/) talk
+ [Programming penalties rather than rewards](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#proving-stake) ensures that the only state transitions worth validating are those that maintain a meaningful consensus. 
	+ It is a profound change in ==how we regulate expression.==
+ Complementary opposites: See [[Kernel Learn Track - Module 0]]
> The most effective way to free meaning is to price it correctly.

### Math beats bureaucracy
+ Pricing different kinds of speech appropriately, rather than trying to "protect" a culturally-conditioned ideal, has the ==second-order cybernetic effect of better securing public goods. ==
	+ Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary and "antidisciplinary" approach concerned with regulatory and purposive systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities. The core concept of the discipline is ==circular causality or feedback—that is, where the outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action.==
	+ E.G. SSTOREs are a relatively expensive operation/expression because storing data on public networks is costly, and it is a cost borne by all of us.
		+ Thus, we agree upon a gas price that incentivizes developers to write contracts which store the minimum possible information required for state-changing, meaningful transactions.
+ It could even be said that **there is no such thing as free speech** on freely accessible public blockchains
+ Increasingly costly expression <- increasingly complex kinds of meaning
	+ Incentives are programmed in such a way that the costs borne by the speaker are always provably more than those imposed on the community of listeners.

### The expanded view
+ The space of **meaningful communications** is greatly expanded when we stop "protecting" free speech
	+ price any speech act according to a ==set of explicit consensus rules== we all agree to follow
+ We can **program** our shared ledger in any way we care to
	+ Favoring those in power = lack of creativity
	+ E.G. Gitcoin Grants and Quadratic Funding: a speech act which donates $1 to a cause can have nearly as great an effect as a donation two orders of magnitude larger, because we've [modelled clearly the most optimal way](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#optimal-gathering) to fund public goods.

> When there is nothing to protect, we no longer need guards. Without guards, the digital world is not about captive audiences, but ==creative participation.==


### Clarifying metaphors
Despite the descriptive limitations of natural language faced with such a construction, we can still be precise about the exceptions to free speech 
1. **Hate speech** (analogous to malicious behaviour or outright attacks on the network) can be more elegantly handled when you are required to have [value-at-a-loss](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#a-defenders-game) to speak meaningfully.
	1. If you then violate rules which are not just social norms, but executable software, ==that value is slashed simultaneously with your speech== and you suffer provably more damage.
2. **Defamation** comes in two flavours: *per se* (a statement that is obviously defamatory) and *per quod* (the defamatory implication must be proven).
	1. **Per se** defamation can be more elegantly handled by [mechanisms](https://our.status.im/discover-a-brave-new-curve/) like that which runs [dap.ps](https://dap.ps/). Anyone can vote in a way which "defames" a product or service, but that vote is also an economic signal denoted in tokens, which are sent straight back to the product or service. So, your downvote causes reputational damage while simultaneously repaying the people you're damaging (programmed according to a curve which makes votes cheaper the richer/higher the rank of whomever you're voting on is).
	2. **Per quod** defamation can be more elegantly handled either by some version of [negative votes](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-5-funding-our-future/) Gitcoin Grants is currently iterating over, or by reputational systems - hopefully [using profiles and actions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#identity-we-can-live-with) - yet to launch.
3. The (in)famous [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) is a great example of how we price transactional expression at the protocol level, which is where the most contentious [debates](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2593.md) occur. Note, however, how such debate centres not on opinion, but engineering [trade-offs](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/consensus/#1-lack-of-disagreement-is-more-important-than-agreement) and technical proof.

This new order of communication, akin to the appearance of language itself, is best demonstrated by:
+ you need only memorize 12 magical **words**, incant them into an internet-connected machine and you gain immediate access to **monetary value**, anywhere in the world. 
+ One can even encode a reference to a newspaper headline in the genesis block of a network of timestamp servers (Satoshi's wording) which run money-as-a-protocol to make a permanent political statement.
