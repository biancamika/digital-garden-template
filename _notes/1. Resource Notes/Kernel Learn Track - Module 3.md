## Take Back the Web
+ Why did the initial visions for the world wide web not work out quite as their inventors intended? It seems that it boils down to ==the incentives== for building it.
+ Tackle the ultimate problem:  ==how to free the shared record of human knowledge from closed, rent-seeking corporations and extricate ourselves from an extractive attention economy.==
### Week 3
+ We cannot hope to succeed where the giants on whose shoulders we stand failed, if we do not understand our own intentions and what freedom really means to each one of us.
+ Incentives are a technical problem which can be consciously engineered and secured with deterministic, auditable, and shared code. However, ==we still have to know why we encode certain incentives and not others.== This goes to the heart of what kind of reality you want to participate in, and what kinds of freedom you genuinely feel are worth speaking into being.

## Intention
So, you want to take back the web? From whom do you want to take it back? Why do you want to take it back? What will you do with it once it's been handed over to your care?

### Reflecting Truth
+ We are conditioned to value ==action and results== over intention. 
	+ We live in a global culture that emphasizes ==what we achieve rather than what we mean.==
+ Actions are, in a sense, how we attempt to ==make the external world match our internal world.==
	+ If you are not clear about your internal world - about what you mean to do - you will never be satisfied with the external world.
	+ How can you hope to improve the world if you do not know how to improve yourself?
+ Our action-oriented culture, driven by results, encourages us to believe that life is about what we can expect of the world. 
	+ However, the reality is that an honest, reflective life is about ==responding truly==, in every moment, to what the world expects of you. 
	+ This is only possible if you constantly ==practice awareness of your intentions.==
	+ Inspired by [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/05/17/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-viktor-frankl/)
+ What's unique about web3 - about economic code which creates new trust spaces; expands the possible definitions of value; merges money and speech; and creates new constraints in which to experiment with freedom - is that ==we can **encode our intentions**, literally. ==
	+ Most importantly, the code with which we express our inner world and meaning then lives independently of us on a shared, global network where it will not change.
+ Not reliant on people
	+ Revolutions always end up failing because they are reliant on people who are error-prone, corruptible, and whose priorities change over time.
	+ Smart contracts will go on no matter what happens to the creator
+ Timechains whose record of history cannot be reverted hold us to a ==higher standard of intentionality.== Now we must develop the inner tools required to live up to our technology.

**Evolution, not revolution**
Lessons from evolution:
1. Use what's already there
2. Every part evolves together
3. Go slow & steady
The overarching moral is this: *humility*.

## Freedom
+ [[Freedom is being conscious of your constraints]].
+ Being defined through complementary opposites...this is what the Buddhists call "[[The freedom of no escape]]"
	+ Nowhere to go but here
	+ By accepting reality as it is, instead of how we wish it to be, we are liberated
	+ [[Freedom from conditioning]]
+ Current struggle isn't collective, but individual?
	+ Western individualism?
	+ There are still collective issues worth fighting for (e.g. basic needs, equal opportunity, just institutions)
	+ Graeber: "Forgive debt and redisribute the land"
	+ What is *also* required is "every soul taking every single step"
		+ Humanity pursuing perceptual knowledge 
		+ Recreating old community in new form
			+ Relevant: [[The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet - Literature Notes]]
+ Freedom is the combination of **awareness and acceptance**
	+ Embracing boundaries > denying them
	+ What makes real liberation a daily experience
	+ Instead of a concept only realized onced an external project comes to fruition
		+ relegating freedom to an idealized future...can't be found there
		+ we need to find it within ourselves 
		+ internal over external
+ Value is generated from **trust in clearly shared truths**
+ Trust in the modern world is an emergent property of protocols that **define + encode cheating**
	+ This prevents cheating without the need for human interpretation or enforcement
	+ E.G. Smart contracts? 
+ Freedom is **is our conscious ability to decide which shared truths to trust** based on how well defined and encoded the concept of "cheating" is
	+ "Cheating" is what creates those truths
		+ Definition through complementary oppposite
	+ We have the freedom to **define what boundaries we choose**
		+ We can't choose to operate without boundaries
		+ The *practice of freedom* includes accepting that we can't exist without limitations
+ Lived freedom is the **conscious navigation of responsibility**
	+ This reminds me of the free will debate
		+ Secular view: [Why You Probably Don't Have Free Will](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/free-will-illusion-sam-harris/)
		+ Religious view:
			+ [Free will in theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_in_theology#:~:text=man%20is%20endowed%20with%20freedom,human%20freedom%20and%20divine%20grace%22.&text=God%20has%20freely%20chosen%20to,the%20work%20of%20his%20grace.)
			+ [Argument from free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will)
	+ free to the extent you take responsibility for the consequences of your actions
+ As someone working in tech...
	+ the products I create shouldn't aim to make people "more free"
		+ false marketing campaigns and dissapointment
		+ automating stuff? probably comes with drawbacks
		+ [[Technology keeps us stuck in a feedback loop with ourselves]]
	+ instead, they should be conscious of, and communicate clearly, how they constrain the people who use them
		+ better Terms of Service? 
	+ this creates an environment for people to become aware of the trade-offs they're making -> only kind of freedom that can be trusted to generate sustainable value
	+ [[Technology must be used as a tool of liberation]]
