### Chapter 2: A Theology of Marriage
#### Prolegomenon
- Theological and historical context
- Eph 5: Paul gives additional context to marriage; it is not only a natural reality but also a =="mystery"==, an image of and a window to God's relationship with his people
- **Historical Introduction**
	- Coontz: Marriage is lived and understood by various cultures throug history
		- Not primarily about individual needs and desires; it had as much to do w/ ==acquiring good in-laws and increasing one's family labor== force as it did with finding a lifetime companion and raising children
		- Also organized the division of labor and power by gender and age
	- Marriage was not fundamentally about love; it was too vital an ==economic and political institution== to be left to two individuals
		- hence the involvement of matchmakers, government, and religion
		- love as the basis for marriage = serious threat to social order and stability
		- Derived from objective conditions and structures outside of marriage itself
	- Schil traces the root cause of these changes (marriage becoming more personal) to ==industrialization==
		- brought about greater mobility of populations and breakdown of extended family
		- Many functions of extended family have been taken over by state machinery 
			- E.G. health insurance, retirement homes, social security, education, daycare
		- The result...
			- It became more important that the choice of spouse be personal rather than imposed from the outside
			- The extended family's influence over personal decisions weakened

#### Marriage as a Human Reality
- **The Human and the Sacramental**
	- the sacraments are based on human realities and are ==religious/faith "interpretations" of these human realities==
	- the sacraments build on the human realities in order to make clearer and more concrete the religious and the divine realities
	- Human reality is =="chronologically prior"==; the religious interpretation does not modify/intrude/reshape the inner structure of the human reality
	- The relationship between the human reality and the divine truth is ==one of sign and meaning==
		- sign should not contradict the meaning
		- human reality as sign should be revelatory of the divine truth...proportinate and adequate to it
- **The human reality that is adopted as a "symbol" of the divine truth and which is given a religious interpretation is ==a good and a value in itself==, even apart from the religious meaning**
	- These human realities were chosen precisely because of their ==intrinsic goodness/value== already even as human realities
	- These values are realized in a special way in marriage
		- Procreative Potential
			- not only the bringing forth, formation, and education of new life
			- but also the spouses "recreating" themselves, becoming better versions
		- Community and Friendship
			- Establish a committed, loving, responsible, exclusive relation — different from any other relationship/friendship
		- Fidelity and Commitment
			- On commitment and freedom
				- freedom from and freedom for
				- freedom is not the ultimate value
				- freedom is only an instrumental value/potential; man is only in the state of "potency" (e.g. musician, athlete, etc.) this potential is realized as a person excercises freedom
				- unless this freedom is excercised, one is even likely to lose these potentials
				- ==commitment is freedom excercised==
			- Why should marriage be a committed relationship?
				- a better way towards maturity than other commited relationships is yet to be found...
				- unless the relationship is committed and this commitment is supported by the community via its values and enforced by its laws, a person could forever be skimming the surface of relations (pleasure-driven)
				- unless committed, a person could go through life in his self-centered ways, no responsibilities, just doing what pleases him, no "spiritual growth"
					- Scott Peck: effort and will norms
			- Any reason to withdraw from a committed relationship?
				- Fidelity and commitment: values related to the ultimate value that is the human person
				- Fidelity and commitment are not the ultimate value...conceivable that observance of fidelity could result in the ultimate value that is the human person
					- Self-sacrifice? Sacrificing something less (yourself) for something greater
				- CAVEAT: the claim that a relationship violates the human person is made more often than warranted
- **This is the human reality that "becomes" a sacrament by virtue of the baptism of the parties**
	- Questions:
		- What does baptism "do" to effect this "ontological" change?
		- How does baptism do this?
	- Answers:
		- Baptism puts the life of the person on a ==different plane of meaning==
		- Through baptism, a person takes on the ==new responsibility of participating in the prophetic mission of Christ and of the church==
		- The marriage of baptized persons has a special meaning
			- See *Infra*

#### The Sacramentality of Marriage
- **Marriage in general (as a human and natural reality) in SS**
	- According to Genesis...
		- Man and woman are different ways of reflecting God's image
		- Their union in marriage is part of God's plan and is thus good
	- According to Hosea...
		- Marriage is seen as an apt symbol of the covenant between Yahweh (ever faithful one) and Israel
		- Prophet Hosea was held as a "model" because of his fidelity to his wife Gomer
		- When a person is baptized, he also assumes a prophetic function in the manner of Hosea, ==to witness to and remind the world of God's fidelity to his covenant==
		- What does the Hosea-Gomer event say about marriage in general?
			- Capacity of marriage to be an ==adequate and appropriate language to be a symbol of God's fidelity==
			- Spouses like Hosea have to be faithful....otherwise Yahweh could not speak through them and their marriage
			- Emphasizes necessity of human responsibility and cooperation with Yahweh
			- Hosea and Gomer: predecessor of Christian spouses
	- According to Mark...
		- context of conversation: divorce in the Old Testament (DIY divorce)
		- Jesus says no to this DIY divorce
			- Moses only allowed this because of the hardness of your heart...but this was not so from the beginning
		- Jesus: Marriage should be stable, not easily breakable, certainly not easily as the DIY divorce
	- Summary and Conclusion
		- Being male and female and their union in marriage is part of ==God's plan==
		- Marriage has the capacity to be a ==language==
			- Has the depth and richness to carry a meaning beyond the natural reality
			- Yahweh used the Hosea-Gomer marriage to reassure Israel of his unconditional fidelity
		- Quality of marriage affirmed by Jesus in Mark is its ==stability==
			- This makes marriage a maturing context even as a natural reality
			- This same quality makes marriage an appropriate symbol and witness to God's fidelity to its people
- **Marriage as a Christian Sacrament (according to Ephesians)**
	- Overview
		- Paul reflects on the richness and depth of the reality of marriage, and attributes it to a special meaning
		- He interprets the "human reality" of marriage and sees God's presence and work in the loving, committed and responsible relationship between man and woman
	- Quotes
		- Genesis 2, 24:
			- Nobility of marriage — one leaves his family of origin to start his/her own family
			- Equality of man and woman — both man and woman shall leave their respective families, and now cling to each other
		- Mark 10: Jesus derived the conjclusion that ==what God has joined together, man must not separate== — the stability/indissoulubility of marriage
		- Paul's take on this text: marriage is a great mystery which refers to ==Christ and the Church==
	- Mystery in Paul summary
		- Eph 5, 32: the word is used to refer to the comparison of marriage to the union of Christ and the Church
		- There is a great hidden truth being revealed in the committed one-flesh relationship between man and wife, and this truth refers to the ==relationship between Christ and the Church==
		- The relationship between H-W should reveal this truth about Christ and the Church
		- H-W, like the apostles, and Hosea and Gomer, ==participate in this prophetic mission to reveal God's fidelity to his people==
	- Theological Reflection
		- Introductory Comments
			- General
				- The structure of the sacrament: like fully human acts, there is a ==material form (sensate)== and a ==meaning (supra sensate)==
					- E.G. bread and wine -> spiritual noruishment
				- There is a proportion of meaning and resonance between the symbol and the meaning
				- "Symbol" is not merely an external reality that stands in the place of its meaning as a substitute reality
					- E.G. blue eage on the facade of the gym, St. Ignatius Loyola kneeling down to offer his sword
				- The symbol has an ==intrinsic connection== with its meaning
					- E.G. flowers and gifts are symbols of your love
					- They are not mere external signs or labels of your love; they also make your love more real + deeper
					- "Efficient" signs that cause something in the relationship
				- The "symbols" in the sacraments were not Catholic inventions; they were taken over and transformed
					- E.G. Water and washing are human realities that lead themselves to symbolic interpretation
					- Old Testament: oil was used to anoint kings due to its preservative qualities
					- Chrisitanity took over these symbols and gave them new meaning
			- When we affirm that baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, marriage etc. are sacraments, we are affirming the ff. of them:
				- They are ==official acts of the Church==
				- They are a means to ==accomplish the mission of Christ== (salvific/redemptive)
				- They are a ==language== through which God speaks to us that we may know him better, a deeper heart-knowledge of God (revelatory)
			- Marriage was the last sacrament to be recognized as an official act of the Church due to some theological difficulties (not yet fully resolved)
				- What is the human reality that becomes a sacrament? Theological consenseus: ==the entire life of the spouses becomes the sacrament, not just the ceremony in the Church==
					- In the beginning, there was no (Catholic) ritual for marraige. The husband and wife just moved in togetehr and they were accepted as married by the community
				- Objection: Marriage includes sexual relations and sex can only be justified when done for procreation; but sex in marriage is not only for procreation so it is actually an opportunity for sin
			- a
		- Marriage as a Sacrament
			- Marriage is an ACT of the CHURCH
				- Marriage is a human reality that many people engage in and live, not just Christians
					- Love each other, raise their kids, fulfill their responsibiltiies, mature and become better persons...
				- When a person is baptized, he is incorporated into the community of the Chruch...==his entire life — actions, loving, being, growing — is collocated on a different plane==
					- E.G. identifying as Atenean, or joining the Glee Club
				- A baptized person assumes his repsonsibilities as a member of the Church...marriage specifices the general responsibility assumed in baptism
				- Christ speaks through the community of the Church to the world
					- He shows his fidelity to his people, his desire to save and to draw us to the fullness that he offers
				- By baptism, the baptized's married life becomes a language of Christ and the Church
					- It is not just their own life, but also of the Church to which they belong
						- E.G. being a Glee Club singer
			- Marriage is SALVIFIC
				- The historical development of the question
					- Augustine/1
						- Literal truth of Genesis 3: there were no uncontrolable passions because everything was according to reason/will of God; sex was only for procreation
						- The first sin created a rupture between man and God, between man and his better self
						- Breakdown in man's wholeness -> man finds himself drawn to different directions
							- Paul: I do what I do not want to do and don't do what I really want to do
						- The disruption of the relation between God and man also happened internally to man
						- Concupscience (state of rebellion of man against God) took this form: the sex act was now governed by pleasure rather than the desire to cooperate with God's will
						- Sex in marriage is not always for procreation...sex is inevitable in marriage, thus sin is inevitable in marriage
						- Marriage is the default vocation of the weak
					- Augustine/2
						- Over time, his theology softened
						- Marriage could be salvific in a negative sense
							- Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you
							- Sex is limited to one's partner, making it less frequent
						- Marriage is redemptive in a negative sense
							- it limits sinfulness
							- it is a damage control measure
					- Gaudium et spes
						- The intimate partnership of life and love is rooted in the ==contract of the partners==, in their ==irrevocable consent==
						- Married love is uniquely expressed and perfected in the marraige act
							- noble and honorable
							- the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude
						- These paradigm-changing insights concern:
							- the understanding of marriage from *contract* (exchange of rights) to consortium totius vitae
							- breaks new ground in understanding the meaning of the sexual act
								- Augustine: 
									- original justice: procreation was faithful to God's intention
									- original sin: pleasure is sinful
								- GS: the marital act ==expresses conjugal love and perfects the love== between husband and wife
						- Comments about GS:
							- enlarged the understanding of marriage ==from mere contract to a life-partnership==
								- contract: rights, sexual rights
								- marriage: unrecognizable as a relationship between friends
							- Contract model saw sexual act as a right (biological POV). Considered moral when intended for procreation. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)
							- Contract model is reflected in discipline of Catholic Church
								- E.G. minimum age for marriage (14 for girls and 16 for boys)
								- marriage is dissolved if not consummated
								- physical impotence is an impediment to marriage
							- Offers a broader and more human understanding as an intimate life-partnership
								- composed of many ingredientts like communication, trust, etc
								- not monolithic, but multifaceted
								- In this context, the sexual act ==can attain and be understood in all its depth and richness==
							- The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. It's not an isolated reality; ==its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouses==
								- sacramental structure: if the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way. at the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears
								- Remember FC: a person is a body informed by an immortal spirit, and a spirit that expresses itself in a body
									- Sexual acts are fully human only if they are part of the love by which man and woman commit themselves to each other
								- The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. 
									- Not merely a passing, momentary pleasure
							- 3rd possible meaning for the sexual act: expression and perfection of love.
								- The effect and cause of deeper love
				- In what way is marriage said to be salvific/redemptive?
					- Thesis:
						- There's a proportion and similarity in meaning between the ==natural reality (symbol) and the sacred (revealed)==
							- E.G. preservative quality of oil -> preservation of new life; bread and wine -> spiritual nourishment
						- Spouses can become better persons — ==marriage is a context in which spouses mature and grow==; they can learn to love and sacrifice
						- "Becoming better persons": good human quality to symbolize and make concrete "salvation" understood as fuller life with God
					- More positive interpretation of marriage is in response to what Waite and Gallagher call =="Myths of post-marriage culture"==
						- Divorce is usually the best answer for kids when the marriage becomes unhappy. *But is divorce always the best answer?*
						- Marriage is all about children; if there's none, spouses may as well break up. But marriage is not all about children; *getting and staying married has a powerful effect on the well-being of adults*
						- Rebutting the claim that marriage may be good for men but bad for women
						- Promoting marriage and marital obligation puts women at risk for domestic violence, and divorce can help women escape this; W and G cite a lot of studies that counter this
						- Marriage is a private matter, and no outsider should be allowed to interfere...
					- Practical consequences of this deconstruction:
						- As marriage ceases to be vital to children, single motherhood is elevated in status. It's no longer just a family tragedy; it's just another personal option in a freedom loving world
						- Higher expectations of marriage
							- Marriage becomes just one of the equally valid lifestyles
							- Marriage is demoted from uniquely honored relationship -> one of the possibile relationships (and no one should interfere)
						- For law practitioners: marriage is a part of continuum of commitment ratehr than a distinctive and distinct relationship
						- At the heart of this deconstruction: ==the attempt to demote marriage from a unique public commitment (supported by law, custom, society, religion) to a private relationship terminable at will==
						- This demotion is done in the name of choice and freedom, but ==reimagining marriage as a purely private relation does not expand anyone's choices==
						- Instead, it takes away from the individual marriage itself: the choice to enter a uniquely powerful and life-enhancing bond
							- way more durable than the immediate shifting feelings of two persons
					- The Marriage Bargain: Is marriage a public institution governed by laws and supported by society? Or is it merely a private emotional relationship built by two people for their personal/individual happiness?
						- If marriage is purely private: the government (or any external body) should not "privilege" marriage
							- You should be treated in the same way by others (whether married or cohabitating)
							- When dissatisfied, you should be able to walk away and find your happiness elsewhere
						- If marriage is a public instution: this changes the social world. 
							- creates obligations between partners, between them and others
							- makes it wrong to have an affair, beause it is wrong to break a vow
						- When married couples are treated differently, it's not discrimination but common sense
							- Married couples should be treated differently because ==marriage makes a difference==...it changes people's golas and behaviors in ways that are life-enhancing
							- It produces good thigns for spouses, children, and society
							- Even if not everyone lives up to their vows, ==the public promise of forever makes a big difference in the way people feel and behave==; it encourages actors to play their roles as responsible husbands and wives
						- This makes the vow liberating: the security of the contract frees individuals to make long term exchanges that leave each other better off
						- Like a contract, it has obligations
							- less freedom to act unilaterally v.s. unmarried persons (e.g. spending money, staying out late)
							- but in exchange, this makes each person more confident in the fidelity of the other
							- ^ less anxiety about sexual performance, less fears about sexual abandonment, less cause for jealousy
						- But it makes people better off because it constrains them from certain behaviors...these are attractive in the short-term, but don't pay off in the long run
						- ==PERMANENCE is key to marriage's transformative power==
							- People in permanent relationships organize their lives differently v.s. people who are less certain
							- This expectation leads to what economists call *specialization*
								- Spouses can develop some skills and neglect others because they can count on their partner (e.g. dividing chores)
								- partnerships increase the pool talent
									- each partner chooses what needs to be done based on their proficiency
									- the couple works like a team
								- Not gender roles...this overly rigid thinking can interfere with specialization
						- Primacy and exclusivity: marriage makes you better off because you become important to someone...someone who loves you and depends on you
							- This knowledge makes marriage the ultimate contract
							- We may have many emotionally fulfilling relationships...but the emotional relationship underlying marriage is fundamentally different from all of these because of the primacy and exclusivity
							- ^ this is expressed and enriched by the sexual act
