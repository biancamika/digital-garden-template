## Hyperlink form
### What's the course about?
*In a few words, e.g. "Language construction workshop" or "How to build an online community"*

### What do you imagine the structure looks like?
*In a few short paragraphs: what are the main learning goals? How long is it and how frequently does it meet? What's the workload? Initial thoughts on what the list of sessions could look like?*

### Who do you imagine is the ideal participant?
*Who should take this course? Who should not take it?*

### How much do you imagine it will cost?
*In USD. rough estimate fine for now; we can discuss further! Our pricing model: you set a price, Hyperlink takes a 20% platform fee, you keep 80%.*
