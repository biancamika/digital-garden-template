#philosophy 
> "A good philosophy is like a good diet. A good diet requires good ingredients, good recipes, good balance ... We need a post-consumerist philosophy of new ingredients, new recipes..." — Jacob Lund Fisker

#life 
> "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." — Henry David Thoreau (Walden)

## Farnam Street

> Often what seems like an expensive solution is a cheap solution (in the long run) and what seems like a cheap solution is very expensive (in the long run).

[[Every purchase is a bargain]]
