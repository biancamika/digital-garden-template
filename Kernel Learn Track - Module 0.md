+ **Pattern recognition is the core of cognition**
	+ best way to improve critical thinking
+ Think in **complementary opposites**
	+ No to dualities like "decentralization good, centralization bad"
	+ There is no good without evil, no North without South, etc.
	+ This is known as **"quantum thought"**
		+ being able to contemplate both 0 and 1 simultaneously, along with the spectrum of probability  between
		+ no need to seek certanity
		+ This humbles us; coupled with wider perspective of total spectrum of possibilties, this can help us make more effective decisions
+ Thus, we should have **humility**
	+ We can't be sure about the consequences of our actions
	+ We can only cultivate an acute observational awareness that can guide us towards making the right trade-offs
### The Honest Question
People who have **positively** changed the world did so because they negotiated complexity over imposing their own will

> ðŸ’¡ What is the question to which you are the universe's answer?

> ðŸ’¡ How can you respond most honestly, accurately, and lovingly?

## Trust
#crypto 
### Liars and cheats
+ Bitcoin: **"Don't trust, verify."**
	+ Trust is only meaningful where verification ends -> fully understanding how people can lie
	+ Application
		+ we can codify the way in which it is possible to cheat 
		+ we can also write executable software rules with deterministic results
			+ prevent cheating in protocols that we use to define and transfer value
+ Demonstration of ==**complementary opposites**==
	+ To understand trust, you must know all possible deceptions
	+ Protocols with strong trust guarantees are built by defining and encoding what it means to lie
	+ Example of [clearly defined and encoded rules](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin/blob/master/ch07.asciidoc)
+ This does not mean that we no longer need trust. It means that **there is an ==implicit== shift from trusting those who own the media by which we transfer value, to those with whom we are actually transacting**
	+ Decentralization at work!

### Viries in Numeris
+ Viries in numeris; another early Bitcoin maxim meaning **"Strength in numbers"**
	+ Pythagoras: "All things are number"
+ This implicit shift is enabled due to a **fundamental change in the language by which value is defined**
	+ Old: Regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and human courts, backed by threat of violence
	+ New: Bitcoin, enables network of peers to create conditions required for functional currency from mathematics alone, enforced by deterministic coputation
+ ==**Trust has something to do with truth**==
	+ The more succintly we can express shared truths, the easier it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use
	+ See this in:
		+ Using numbers and mathematical consenseus gives us the strength to lay down "unassailable facts" (according to Andreas Antonopoulos)
		+ What gives power and meaning to any narrative? The community which believes it
+ Publicly verifiable truth -> more people can reach consenseus on the basic state of their shared realities, and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of trust
+ **Profound feedback loop**
	+ Use universal language (math) to define succintly what it means to cheat
	+ Enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions (code)
	+ These definitions allow more people to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously unimaginable
+ TL;DR: we can make it easier to verify and trust the systems that we use by **succintly expressing shared truth**

> To dream up important ideas you must think like an **idealist**; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an **adversary**.

### Access-ability
+ Deterministic verifi**ability** between peers > trust based on blind faith
+ Ability -> access; see how Bitcoin source code can be auditied by anyone, anywhere in the world
+ Trust has a lot to do with transparency and education
+ Requires architectural innovation in structure of money
	+ No more clients and servers
	+ Everyone needs to be a peer
+ Nicky Case: ==We **are** each other's environment==

### Curated Readings
https://ncase.me/trust/
> "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", may be not just a ==moral== truth, but also a ==mathematical== truth.

> In 1985, when Americans were asked how many close friends they had, the most common answer was "three". In 2004, the most common answer was "zero". We now have fewer friends across class, racial, economic, and political lines, because we have fewer friends -- period. And as you just discovered for yourself, **the fewer =="repeat interactions"== there are, the more distrust will spread.** 

> With a ==lower "win-win" reward==, **cheating** takes over. Game theory has two powerful ideas about this: 
> **"Zero-sum game".** This is the sadly common belief that a gain for "us" must come at a loss to "them", and vice versa. 
> **"Non-zero-sum game".** This is when people make the hard effort to create a win-win solution! (or at least, avoid a lose-lose) ==Without the non-zero-sum game, trust cannot evolve.== 

> This is why =="miscommunication"== is such an interesting barrier to trust: **a little bit of it leads to forgiveness, but too much and it leads to widespread distrust!** I think our modern media technology, as much as it's helped us increase communication... has increased our miscommunication much more. 

Game theory shows us the three things we need for the **evolution of trust**:
1. Repeat interactions
2. Possible win-wins
3. Low miscommunication

> **What the game is, defines what the players do.**
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,
it's that our *environment* acts against the evolution of trust. 
> That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. **In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.**
> So, do what you can do, to ==create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.== Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together...
