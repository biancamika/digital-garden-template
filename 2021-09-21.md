### The goal of ethics
**Ethics is the quest for the good life.**
A life of excellence is a life of virtue.

### Platonic Moral Theory
**Doctrine of teleology:** everything in the universe has a purpose/function within a hierarchy of purposes/functions.
**Theory of forms:** there is a world of forms where the eternal and perfect models of the things in the world exist.

### Theory of the Soul
*The soul existed prior to its union with the body.*
The soul is composed of two main aprts:
+ the rational (reason)
+ the irrational (spirit and appetite)

### Tripartite Nature of the Soul
The soul performs three functions. To each function corresponds a power in the soul.
+ Reason: awareness of a goal
+ Spirit: drive towards action
+ Appetite: appetite for bodily things

### Pre-Existent State of the Soul
The soul enjoyed a basic harmony between its rational and irrational parts -- a harmony wherin reason controlled the spirit and appetites through its knowledge of the truth.
The reaason could suggest a goal for behavior only to be overcome by sensual appetite, and the power of the spirit could be pulled ni eitehr direction by these sensual desires.

### Analogy of the Charioteer
The condition of the man may be likened to the charioteer driving two horses. One horse is good, another is bad. 
Though the charioteer has a clear vision of where to go and the good horse is on course, the bad horse misbehaves...

**Temperance**: moderation. appetites kept within limits and in their measure. The art of living requires knowledge of limits and of measure.

### Morality as Recovery of Lost Harmony
*Only knowledge can produce virtue while ignorance/false knowledge produces evil*

### Moral Evil
Evil or vice is caused by ignorance/false knowledge when the passions influence reasons to think what appears to bring happiness will do so and cannot.
**Ignorance:** when people are ignorant, their personalities are disorganized because unruly desires/passions control them
**Knowledge:** when people truly know what is good, they will do what is really good

### Meaning of Virtue
+ **Virtue means knowledge.**
+ **Virtue is the fulfillment of a unique function.**
